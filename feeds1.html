It was the same gesture you might use to escort an old lady, and, when the next officer did this to me, that is what I thought it was. But then, halfway across the street, he cuffed my hands behind my back.\n<p>\nThere was no warning. No Miranda rights like in the movies. At first, I was incredulous. It was not until I got my desk ticket that night for blocking traffic that I had any idea what the officer was accusing me of doing.\n<p>\nI was a head shorter than the officer. I said to him, "You know I was on the sidewalk." He wouldn\'t meet my eyes. I was two blocks from my apartment. But because I was part of a protest, I was no longer a local. I was an obstruction to be cleared.\n<p>\nGoing into the police van, they snapped my picture on a Fujimax Polaroid knockoff, hipster party style. I gave them my best grin. A man in a suit passed by, looked us over, and said to the police, "nice work."\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/22/opinion/crabapple-occupy-wall-street/index.html">My arrest at Occupy Wall Street </a>', 'language': None}]

(<a href="http://boingboing.net/tag/Great-Graphic-Novels">Read all the Great Graphic Novel essays here</a>.) -- Mark</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>From Hell</em>, by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0958578346/boingboing"><img align="left" alt="From hell" border="0" height="227" src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/from-hell.jpg" title="from-hell.jpg" width="250" /></a>It only took me about five seconds to settle upon the graphic novel that has most successfully blown me away: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0958578346/boingboing"><em>From Hell</em></a> by Alan Moore (writer) and Eddie Campbell (artist).</p>\n\n<p>Clocking in at close to 600 pages, this is not a one-evening read, as too many graphic novels are. It is also not the world\'s loveliest artistic feast. The art is stark black and white scratchy pen-work and I have to say that Eddie Campbell\'s style is an acquired taste. But it perfectly suits Alan Moore\'s complex script about the Jack the Ripper killings in London in the 1880s.</p>\n\n<p>There is plenty of blood spilled as the killings proceed, and the fact that it is all in black ink -- not red - helps maintain a certain aesthetic distance from the dirty deeds being done. I think of the book as being drawn in soot, which certainly defined late-Victorian London, where the famous fog was actually smog.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short: Moore immersed himself in the various conspiracy theories about who Jack the Ripper really was and settled on an amalgamated premise that Jack was really the Queen\'s physician, William Gull, and the murders were part of a monstrous occult Masonic ritual. The truth was ostensibly covered-up by Masons in positions of power and justice was never rendered.</p>\n\n<p>This is, I think, a preposterous premise, but it is an engrossing one, nevertheless, and if one just suspends disbelief and allows Moore to sweep one along on his dark horse-drawn carriage ride, there are hours of finely-nuanced entertainment to be had.</p>\n\n<p>The movie version of <em>From Hell</em>, starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham, was a telegraphed and watered down version of the story that Moore spins. It had its moments, particularly in capturing the spooky atmosphere of late nights in the East End, but if you even half-way enjoyed the movie, you owe it to yourself to read the original graphic novel.</p>\n\n<p>(Various disclaimers: I became a Mason around the time that <em>From Hell</em> was first published, my wife was Matron of Honour at Alan Moore\'s and Melinda Gebbie\'s wedding in Northampton, UK, and we all remain friends. That said, I\'d still stand by <em>From Hell</em> as a graphic novel masterpiece, even if I were not a Mason and didn\'t know Alan Moore from Joe Blow.)</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0958578346/boingboing"><em>From Hell</em>, by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell</a></p>', 'language': None}]

Most of us will lose a substantial fraction of our visual acuity, should we live long enough. As a service to his readers, Goodwins is documenting the way that technology can be adapted for people with visual disabilities. It\'s a fascinating story: as he says, "there\'s never been a better time to go blind: we are busy converting the world to digital, and digital is supremely easy to convert." \n<p>\nBut that\'s only true as long as there\'s no DRM in the mix. Once DRM gets into your information stream, your ability to adapt what\'s happening on your screen to work with your disability is severely curtailed. As Goodwins discovered, the world of ebooks is especially hard on people with visual disabilities.\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n...[I]t turned out I needed Adobe Digital Editions to \'manage my content\'. Some fun later \u2014 you have to download it from a particularly brain-dead web page with teeny-tiny dialog boxes that were broken in Chrome and invisible in Firefox \u2014 and I had a large blob of code to install on my Windows box.\n<p>\nIt tried, of course, to force me to give Adobe my email and other details for the \'Adobe ID\' that it assured me I needed to get full functionality. I demurred... and was confronted by a user interface that was tiny white text on a black background. Unreadable. Options to change this? If they exist, I couldn\'t find them.\n<p>\nGetting this far had taken me half an hour fighting my way through a nest of misery and frustration with broken eyes and a sinking heart. Along the way, I\'d been bombarded by marketing messages telling me to "enjoy the experience" and "enjoy your book".\n<p>\nReader, I wept. Marketing departments, here\'s a top tip: if your customer is reduced to actual, hot, stinging tears, you may wish to fine-tune your messaging.\n<p>\nThis is the reward you get for being disabled and wanting to do the right thing. This is how the world\'s most splendid machine for freeing our minds from our physical shackles is itself being shackled. This is what will happen to all of you reading this as you get old. I know this, I\'ve done the research: most of you will start to go blind before you die.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/going-blind-drm-will-dim-your-world-7000004586/">Going blind?

They liked the result so much that the published the HOWTO on Instructables.\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n\n\nPerhaps one of the more useful tools I have ever owned was a flat bar with a series of hexagonal cutouts in it. While minimally useful as a wrench because of its long length, it proved invaluable as backstop for holding nuts in place while I was tightening them down. Not to mention that when my wrench set was annoyingly missing just the size I needed, my hard to misplace flat bar always had me covered.\n<p>\nIt therefore stood to reason that a Katana with a similar series of hexagonal cutouts would be valuable both for taking down Zombies/Mutant wildlife and complementing any set of tools used for post apocalyptic DYI projects. However, after a bit of research it became apparent that in addition to being expensive to make, \u201cKatanas are notoriously high maintenance\u201d* and at ApocalypsEV we hate the idea of high cost high maintenance (www.ApocalypsEV.com).\n<p>\nSo seeking a simpler more affordable concept, we created the Mechanics Machete. It combines the Zombie fighting power of a machete with the utility of a set of wrenches. Also when using stainless steel for the blade, it eliminates the maintenance hassle of trying to keep the blade rust free.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nEvery time I see a hex-wrench made by cutting a shape out of a piece of metal, I remember <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/10/25/gatwick-airport-took-away-my-belt-buckle-i-stick-to-what-theyve-told-me-im-not-going-to-speak-to-you-anymore-not-if-youre-going-to-publish-it-im-not-speaking-to-you.html">the time Gatwick airport security stole my belt-buckle</a>, including the little loop that held the belt\'s tongue, because the loop had a hexagonal cutout that was a "wrench."\n\n\n<p>\n<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Apocalypse-Mechanics-Machete/">Apocalypse Mechanics Machete</a>\n\n(<i>via <a href="http://neatorama.com">Neatorama</a></i>)', 'language': None}]

        <br>
        [{'base': u'http://boingboing.net/feed', 'type': u'text/html', 'value': u'<p>\n<img align="right" class="bordered" src="http://craphound.com/images/bad-pharma-how-drug-companies-mislead-doctors-and-harm-patients.jpg" />\nWriting in the <em>Guardian</em>, Ben Goldacre reveals the shocking truth about the drugs that doctors prescribe: thanks to aggressive manipulation from the pharmaceutical companies and passivity from regulators, doctors often don\'t know that the drugs were ineffective (or harmful) in a majority of their clinical trials. That\'s because pharma companies set up their trials so that they the right to terminate ones that look unpromising (or stop them early if they look promising and report on the result partway through as though it reflected the whole trial), and to simply suppress the results of negative trials. \n<p>\nAs a result, doctors -- even doctors who do their homework and pay close attention to the published trials, examining their methodology carefully -- end up prescribing useless (or harmful) medicines. And according to Goldacre, this is true of all doctors in every country, because every country\'s regulators allow pharmaceutical companies to cynically manipulate research outcomes to increase their profits. As Goldacre points out, a 2010 Harvard/Toronto study showed that "85% of the industry-funded studies were positive, but only 50% of the government-funded trials were" -- and in another analysis, industry-funded trials of statins "were 20 times more likely to give results favouring the test drug."\n<p>\nWhat\'s more, when scientists blow the whistle on this life-threatening criminality, they\'re smeared and hounded by the pharma companies, as happened when Danish scientists published a study critical of industry-funded trials in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>. After the study was published, Lif, the Danish pharmaceutical industry association, called for professional misconduct investigations into the researchers, though they couldn\'t provide any evidence of the alleged misconduct. Though the researchers were cleared of all wrongdoing, their employers were given copies of the accusations of scientific dishonesty, as did "the Danish medical association, the ministry of health, the ministry of science and so on." \n<p>\n\nThis long piece is an excerpt from Goldacre\'s forthcoming book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0007350740/downandoutint-21">Bad Pharma: How drug companies mislead doctors and harm patients</a>.\n<br clear="all" />\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\nSometimes trials are flawed by design. You can compare your new drug with something you know to be rubbish \u2013 an existing drug at an inadequate dose, perhaps, or a placebo sugar pill that does almost nothing. You can choose your patients very carefully, so they are more likely to get better on your treatment. You can peek at the results halfway through, and stop your trial early if they look good. But after all these methodological quirks comes one very simple insult to the integrity of the data. Sometimes, drug companies conduct lots of trials, and when they see that the results are unflattering, they simply fail to publish them.\n<p>\nBecause researchers are free to bury any result they please, patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine. Doctors can have no idea about the true effects of the treatments they give. Does this drug really work best, or have I simply been deprived of half the data? No one can tell. Is this expensive drug worth the money, or has the data simply been massaged? No one can tell. Will this drug kill patients? Is there any evidence that it\'s dangerous? No one can tell. This is a bizarre situation to arise in medicine, a discipline in which everything is supposed to be based on evidence.\n<p>\nAnd this data is withheld from everyone in medicine, from top to bottom. Nice, for example, is the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, created by the British government to conduct careful, unbiased summaries of all the evidence on new treatments. It is unable either to identify or to access data on a drug\'s effectiveness that\'s been withheld by researchers or companies: Nice has no more legal right to that data than you or I do, even though it is making decisions about effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, on behalf of the NHS, for millions of people.\n<p>\nIn any sensible world, when researchers are conducting trials on a new tablet for a drug company, for example, we\'d expect universal contracts, making it clear that all researchers are obliged to publish their results, and that industry sponsors \u2013 which have a huge interest in positive results \u2013 must have no control over the data. But, despite everything we know about industry-funded research being systematically biased, this does not happen. In fact, the opposite is true: it is entirely normal for researchers and academics conducting industry-funded trials to sign contracts subjecting them to gagging clauses that forbid them to publish, discuss or analyse data from their trials without the permission of the funder.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nJust read it. There\'s so much more. Paroxetine, a drug that was known to be ineffective for treating children, which had a risk of suicide as a side-effect, widely prescribed to children, because GlaxoSmithKline declined to publish its research data after an internal memo stated "It would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine."\n<p>\n\n<p>\n\n\n<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/21/drugs-industry-scandal-ben-goldacre">The drugs don\'t work: a modern medical scandal</a>', 'language': None}]

        <br>
        [{'base': u'http://boingboing.net/feed', 'type': u'text/html', 'value': u'<p><em><a href="http://www.ideo.com/people/david-kelley">David Kelley</a> is the founder of <a href="http://www.ideo.com">IDEO</a>  and the <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/">Stanford d.school</a> \n</em>\n\n<p class="caption">\nDavid Kelley shares the IDEO Design Process\n\n<p><strong>Avi Solomon:</strong> Were the seeds of your future career planted in your childhood?\n<p><strong>David Kelley: </strong>I don\'t know, I feel I was just a lucky kid.  So many kids are not allowed to flourish their creativity.  But I was the kind of kid that would take apart the family piano. I can remember I had a perfectly good bicycle I got for Christmas and a few days later I had sandblasted it and painted it a different color.  Not that my parents understood why I was always ripping things apart and redesigning them but I was certainly tolerated.  So I think it did contribute in a lot of ways.  I wish for a lot of other kids that they could tinker like I did.<span id="more-182668"></span>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Avi:</b> What led you to found IDEO?\n<p><b>David:</b> Well, I had just fallen in love with design at Stanford.  I was a regular engineer before I got to Stanford where I got into <a href="http://designprogram.stanford.edu/history.html">a program that taught the human side of engineerin</a>g.  I really fell in love with the notion of doing something for humans rather than just doing something technologically.  Silicon Valley was just starting to do really well and then it became clear that a lot of companies had the need to have somebody who was sensitive to the design, the aesthetics, the humans <em>and</em> the engineering stuff.  That combination seemed really obviously needed in Silicon Valley.  That made it easier to start IDEO.\n\n<p><b>Avi:</b> Is that what led you also to the importance of anthropological fieldwork in design?\n<p><b>David:</b> Yes, Stanford had this thing called <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs447/docs/NeedFindingCribSheet.pdf">Needfinding</a>. I had always learned about problem solving but Stanford taught me in that it was just important to worry about figuring out the kind of human needs that were worth working on and then doing the problem-solving.  It just seemed to be much more interesting when you got to figure out what was the real problem you were working on.\n\n<p><b>Avi:</b> So Needfinding is  a way of locking onto the critical problems because there are so many problems to solve.\n<p><b>David:</b> You\'re absolutely right.  The way to do it is to go out and figure out what humans actually value.  Having empathy for people was so exciting.  You don\'t usually think of engineers as people people, so to speak, but my experience has been that when engineers really feel that something would be important to people, would have meaning in people\'s lives, that\'s highly motivating and it makes them work really hard.\n\n<p><b>Avi:</b> It also increases the engineer\'s chance of success.\n<p><b>David:</b> For sure. The way we used to do it before was by sitting around the room and figuring out what was a cool idea and then we\'d talk people into wanting it.  Much better to know what people want and then use your talent to design that.\n\n<p><b>Avi:</b> What is your definition of design?\n<p><b>David:</b> What I mean by design is doing things with intention, trying to decide what\'s important to somebody, building a bunch of prototypes and showing them around, developing a point of view and getting it out so that it has impact in the world.  So design is really a process of making impact on the world by doing this kind of creation of something new to the world and then getting it out there.\n\n<p><b>Avi:</b> If it\'s a process then how do you explain Steve Jobs?\n<p><b>David:</b> Steve Jobs used a design process.  He just shortcut it.  I worked for Steve for many, many years in the early days of Apple and he had an uncanny sense of what would be the next thing, what humans want, that they would want it or not want it.  That\'s not so common in an individual.  Usually we have teams of people that do that but he was doing the same thing, which is basically predicting what people want and painting a picture of the future and then getting it out there.  He did a very good job of that. Steve was an incredible guy but it doesn\'t get you around the fact that you have to try things out and see if they fit into people\'s lives and if people value them. \n\n<p><b>Avi:</b> What are the characteristics of a designer?\n<p><b>David:</b> The characteristics of a designer that I appreciate the most are this thing about having empathy for people, that you expect to get your big ideas from talking to people and your own experiences, that you have a bias towards action, that you\'re not going to sit around and noodle strategy details for a long time, you\'re going to actually go out and build something and show it to people and iterate the feedback. \n\n<p>Designers are more likely to build something and then refine it, rather than think they have the big idea all in one big jump.  Then there\'s the notion of doing things with intention.  Designers I know care about every little detail, they try to really understand the experience the person\'s going to have. \n\n<p>My students recently designed the experience of taking the train to San Francisco. As in anything we do we looked at everything that\'s involved with the customer journey.  Looking up the ad and finding out what services and planning your trip, getting to the train station, getting through the lines, waiting, boarding.  Then there\'s the riding the train but there\'s also finding your way when you get out. Designers do everything with intention so they care about every little thing.  That\'s why the out of the box experience is really important.  What every little sticker looks like is really important.  That\'s characteristic of designers.\n\n<p class="caption"><a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/">Stanford Design Thinking Virtual Crash Course</a>\n\n<p><b>Avi:</b> You have been quite open about sharing your design process.\n<p><b>David:</b> What we do is put out a design framework as our potential process then we expect people to modify it to meet their own needs.  So it\'d be foolish for me to say "This is the process.  Do this step, do this step, do this step."  One size doesn\'t fit all but it is a recipe to learn.  You add your own fertilizer and water and soil and you make your own process out of it.\n\n<p>The first step in the process is what we call the Understand phase: if you\'re going to work in a certain area you really need to talk to experts.  We\'re generalists, we\'re expert at process but if you really want to do something, if you\'re going to design a new medical device, you have to really immerse yourself in it.  So in the first step you end up studying the state of the art, going and talking to experts, doing research to bring yourself up to speed.  You\'d be really surprised how quickly you can get up to speed, even in a highly technical area, just from doing a little research and talking to experts.  They\'ll tell you a lot more than you can use, more than you could ever imagine.\n\n<p>Then there\'s the Observation phase.  There\'s plenty to learn from interviewing people but we think that you learn a lot more from being there.  So we jump right out, we go around the world, we go wherever there\'s interesting people.  If we\'re going to design a new gas station we\'ll go and see how they pump gas in Japan. How do they get gasoline where there\'s no gas station whatsoever?  We just hang out, watching over and over and seeing what the issues are.  We find that if we\'re going to have some kind of breakthrough, a lot of times we see it by just being there.  We\'re watching nurses and we see how nurses have trouble with the shift change, or we watch somebody using a vending machine.\n\n<p>I was watching people pay for parking at one of those vending machines where you take your ticket and you put it in and just seeing all the trouble that they had, they\'re grimacing, they\'re panicking.  So for us this is a lead to where there\'s an innovation that can be done.  If you see somebody having trouble using something, or that they grimace or they\'re unhappy or they\'re scared, that\'s a place that we could really do innovation because we can fix that.\n\n<p>At some point by observing these people and building empathy for them you start to have insights about them.  "Oh, they really do value this.  It\'s not obvious at first that that\'s what they really value. They say they really don\'t do something but it turns out they actually do when you observe them."  Because this thing\'s a team sport you have all these different eyes watching.  We\'ll have the business person and the technology person and the psychologist or anthropologist, so they see different things.\n\n<p>My mentor, Bob McKim used to say "A fish doesn\'t know it\'s wet," meaning it\'s hard for an expert in one field to see clearly.  So these teams that have people with different methodologies, by definition they\'re kind of naive.  They have what we call child\'s mind, so they see new things to the world.  And that gives them insights about what could happen, and also enables breakthrough products and services.\n\n<p>The next phase we call Visualize.  Okay, now I\'ve seen some problems, I know what I want, I have some big ideas from the observations that I\'ve done.  Now I want to visualize some possible solutions.  I have developed a point of view: I think that the problem with checking into a hospital is that it\'s just too redundant.  I think the problem is is you should be able to do things in advance of getting there, right?  So that\'s my point of view. Then I start building systems.  I start making physical things out of cardboard, I start making prototypes or I start making quick and dirty videos that show the solution.  If it\'s a service like checking into a hospital I make a video of what I think would be a really cool, efficient, better way.  I\'m painting the future of what it would mean in that hospital by making a video.\n\n<p>Then comes the Iteration phase.  I start showing the prototype around.  This is the big win, because I haven\'t fooled around or tried to cover myself or be careful, I just cranked out a few possible prototypes or videos of the future and then I start showing them to smart people.  It\'s amazing how people will help you.  These prototypes that we make are not precious, they\'re quick and dirty.  They just get our ideas out so that we can get help from other people.  So now you\'re using the brain power of everybody else.  Anybody can do these type of prototypes, right? \n\n<p>So understand, observe, visualize and iterate. The trick here is that the big deal is the iteration.  Rather than planning incessantly you quickly come up with something, you show it to smart people, you show it to users, and then you do it again and again.  So a lot of times with my students I give the same problem over and over again because you can always get it better.\n\n<p><b>Avi:</b> You are bringing this process to the K-12 system?\n<p><b>David:</b> I\'ve always had an interest in K-12 because I really think that\'s where to start.  What happens with kids is that they\'re wildly creative when they\'re younger and then if you follow them around the fourth grade or so they kind of opt out.  Some large percentage of them say, "Oh, I\'m not creative," so that they can\'t be judged.  So somehow they\'ve done something, they\'ve drawn a picture of a horse and the teacher didn\'t like it so they\'ve just kind of given up.  And this is the thing we\'re trying to solve, which is we really believe that kids, if they have creative confidence that they\'re a creative person they\'ll use kind of both sides of their brain, they\'ll use the analytical stuff that they learn in school and they\'ll be open to using their intuitive mind, and they\'ll trust it, and they\'ll make better decisions.  So that\'s the premise behind <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/redlab/cgi-bin/">the K-12 lab at Stanford</a>.\n\n\n<p>So by <a href="http://designthinkingforeducators.com/">training teachers</a>, by having kids come through, by us going into the classroom and teaching them design thinking and just using design thinking methodology to solve some of their problems we\'ve had great luck and we\'re very proud of what\'s going on there.  I really think that\'s the point:  if you want to make a big change, get all the kids thinking of themselves as a creative person.  They\'re just going to have that openness that will allow them to come up with new and different ideas that they can choose.  When we talk about having ideas, we talk about fluency and flexibility.  Fluency means you can quickly come up with lots of ideas like in brainstorming, but flexibility means that they\'re different one from the next.  So you have lots of ideas and they\'re unique ideas.  That\'s going to help you make a better decision.  \n\n<p>I don\'t care if that\'s about something in your personal life or whether it\'s your job of curing cancer, having a better variety of ideas is going to make better decisions. So we think by ingraining that in students in K12 we can make a difference.\n\n\n<p>', 'language': None}]

I have most of \'em and I recognize that they are magnificent achievements. On the other hand I haven\'t read many of them all the way through because despite their greatness they wore me out or bummed me out or left me out in some other way... like <em>Moby Dick</em> did. I never could get through that indisputably great book.</p>\n\n<p>And so I\'m going to recommend a graphic novel that is great because it is good, solid and delivers in spades what I most enjoy in a comic book; a comfortable mastery of the form, fun, surprises, a story I can get into and a light touch. In short its the kind of book you can flop down on the couch with of an afternoon, lie back and enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s <em>M&eacute;nage &agrave; Bughouse</em> by Steve Lafler, published by CO2 and available <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/steve-lafler/m%C3%A9nage-%C3%A0-bughouse/paperback/product-20168921.html">here</a>.</p>', 'language': None}]

And back in April, I <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/04/18/boneshaker-author-ask.html">blogged</a> Kate Milford\'s Kickstarter pitch to fund a print-on-demand half-sequel to act as a bridge between <em>Bone Shaker</em> and its direct sequel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0547739664/downandoutint-20">The Broken Lands</a>. \n<p>\nThat Kickstarter was fully funded, and Milford used the money to produce a beautiful little print-on-demand paperback (printed and sold by the excellent McNally-Jackson bookstore in Manhattan) called <a href="http://clockworkfoundry.com/excerpt-the-kairos-mechanism/">The Kairos Mechanism</a>. As with <em>Boneshaker</em>, <em>Kairos</em> is a haunting and inspiring young adult story set in 1913 small-town Missouri, and it tells the story of what happens when two boys appear out of a corn field with a stretcher bearing the freshly shot body of a man who died in the Civil War, 50 years previous. Filled with mystery, canonfire and the horrors of war and a villain who\'s nightmare-scary, <em>Kairos Mechanism</em> is a great interlude and a fine way to tide readers over after we finish the just-published <em>Broken Lands</em>.\n<p>\n<a href="http://www.mcnallyjackson.com/bookmachine/kairos-mechanism-kate-milford">The Kairos Mechanism</a>', 'language': None}]

        <a href='http://boingboing.net/2012/09/21/kickstarter-re-commits-to-idea.html'>Kickstarter re-commits to ideas instead of pre-orders</a> by Glenn Fleishman, Fri Sep 21 23:47:20 2012
        <br>
        [{'base': u'http://boingboing.net/feed', 'type': u'text/html', 'value': u'<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-182602" src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/The-pitfalls-and-perils-of-Kickstarter-300x178.jpeg" />The crowdfunding site Kickstarter <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-is-not-a-store">updated its policies for hardware and product design</a> categories today in a manner that will absolutely cost the firm money, but relieves a bunch of the tension that\'s been rising over the last year with million-dollar-plus fundraising for items that see substantial delays in delivery.</p>\n<p>Kickstarter won\'t allow drawings or simulations for products and electronics. Only the current state of a prototype can be pictured or shown in action (if there is any action) in video. Further, project creators can\'t sell multiples of an item, except if it\'s a set of disparate things. This will change things in a big way that should be good for Kickstarter and creators both. (All project impresarios will also have to fill out a "risks and challenges" section about what could go wrong and why someone is competent to fulfill the project. I encouraged this already to anyone asking me how to plan a project; I\'m glad it\'s codified.)</p>\n<p><span id="more-182593"></span></p>\n<p>Kickstarter began as a way for creative projects to bring their audience to a place where it was easy to give money that was primarily support for an idea and secondarily relied on rewards, much like public radio and TV. You don\'t back a ballerina choreographing and staging a performance because you want the tote bag she designed, and you could always buy a ticket to her show later. No: you\'re buying into her success.</p>\n<p>In that model, the reward is a separate thing from the thing being backed. For instance, 99% Invisible, a radio show I love, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1748303376/99-invisible-season-3">raised money to fund its third season</a>. The rewards are notepads, T-shirts, audio recorded by host Roman Mars, and more. But the true reward is that we all get the show (and 40 episodes instead of 30). The $170,500 raised (for a $42,000 goal) doesn\'t mean more gizmos must be made; rather, Mars hired a near full-time editor, can produce a video episode, and will create a smartphone app, as well as hire designers to revamp the Web site. (He can also sleep a bit more.) The scope changed slightly, but not overwhelmingly. He has a bunch of shipping envelopes to stuff for a short period of time.</p>\n<p>That\'s distinct from the rising trend since not long after Kickstarter\'s early days for both newbie and professional industrial and hardware designers to turn to crowdfunding for new projects. In this model, the <em>project</em> and the <em>reward</em> are essentially identical. Some rewards include intangibles, special editions, and the like. But the essential process is a pre-order: "Give me that thing." Those backing a project are mostly not patrons of an idea. When the thing is late or it never emerges, that then turns into a consumer-protection issue rather than one of\xa0 disappointment or frustration.</p>\n<p>Way back in November 2009, I backed <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/john-sundman/creation-science">John Sundman\'s new book "Creation Science."</a> It\'s still not in my hands. He wound up becoming more successful than he\'d imagined in other areas, and the funding for the book was relatively tiny. He works a living. I didn\'t give $15 to demand a book in a year! I gave it because I liked his writing. Someday, I hope, to read the book. But I\'m not disappointed that it\'s not done, because his career and life have improved so much. That\'s what being a patron is about, as opposed to being a consumer.</p>\n<p>Arts that become expressed as an instantiation\u2014like a book or movie, rather than performance or an event\u2014float a little between product and idea. But I\'d argue that you\'re still backing bringing something into intellectual existence, which then gets manufactured in a very standard way into something digital or physical. An iPhone dock, however pretty, is an iPhone dock. A film is an idea made manifest in its creation, and the arts of mechanical and electronic reproduction puts that idea in your hands.</p>\n<p>There\'s also a reason to call out hardware and products as opposed to computer software. Software has much the same problem whether you fulfill 100,000 copies or 1,000 copies through a digital download. Software has a much higher risk of delay. (Go read Scott Rosenberg\'s <em><a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/">Dreaming In Code</a></em> for an exegesis on why.) But that risk is better implicitly understood by most of us who have waited for a software update or new release than tapping our foot for prototyped things made of atoms that appear to be ready to head into a manufacturing cycle.</p>\n<p>Conflict over the patron/consumer worldviews has grown this year as computer hardware and other projects started bringing in dozens to a 100 times the original goal amount to receive funding. Delays abound with completed projects, and concerns remain over projects that haven\'t passed their deadline. This is partly because of scale.</p>\n<p>The makers of the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android?ref=most-funded">Pebble E-Paper Watch</a> set out for $100,000 and brought in $10.3 million before halting the campaign. Delivery was planned for September, but now is "soon." A target of 15,000 watches a week is the goal towards making about 85,000 total. That means even were shipping to begin in October, some backers wouldn\'t see a watch til December.</p>\n<p>People are also concerned about <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console?ref=most-funded">Ouya</a>, an open-platform video game system that raised $8.6 million against a $950,000 goal, and has rewards to fulfill of roughly 60,000 controllers by March 2013. It has to go from production to manufacture, as well as finalizing the software platform\xa0 and releasing a developer SDK.</p>\n<p>I could go on. Wired ran a story about five overdue Kickstarters a few months ago (a couple of which have now finished fulfillment), and I have a clipping file in Instapaper of more than a dozen articles that look into which big projects are late.</p>\n<p>Many people ask me regularly, knowing my interest in crowdfunding, whether Kickstarter has hit the inflection point of having too many big projects too fast that are out of control. I say, no: every project has its own community and audience. Failures or delays in big projects won\'t necessarily have a halo effect outside the group that backed them, although a continued pattern in that direction (especially if a complete, million-dollar-plus wipeout occurred) could certainly cause a broader level of aversion.</p>\n<p>Yancey Strickler, one of the company\'s founders, spoke at <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/09/19/xoxo.html">the XOXO Festival</a> last weekend, and I had a moment\'s chat with him. As he did on stage, he emphasized to me that the staff isn\'t as fascinated with the blockbusters as the rest of the world appears to be. Thousands of projects run through Kickstarter every month, and most are modest. A healthy half are funded, putting hundreds of dollars to tens of thousands of dollars towards quite achievable goals. They love the little stories, of which there are so many.</p>\n<p>This new policy seems absolutely consonant with Kickstarter\'s chief stated goals: turning ideas into reality, not selling stuff. Kickstarter takes 5% of all funded projects. With these rules in place, perhaps Pebble would have funded at $1,000,000 instead of ten times that. That would have reduced Kickstarter\'s fee from $500,000 to $50,000. But the potential drop in commissions doesn\'t seem to bother the founders as they recalibrate against their founding mission. It doesn\'t hurt that many of Kickstarter\'s investors are community builders who may want a financial return, but not at the expense of the broader mission.</p>\n<p>One of the bits of buzz about Kickstarter, including at the XOXO conference, was how a new model might emerge for dealing with things being manufactured in large quantities that had never been made before. It\'s possible Kickstarter closing some doors here means another company will open them, with a different set of rules and expectations, and perhaps a real focus on incubating, accepting pre-orders for, and releasing mass-produced products when the time is right.</p>', 'language': None}]

        [{'base': u'http://captainawkward.com/feed/', 'type': u'text/html', 'value': u'<p><em>Hi Captain,</em></p>\n<p><em>I want to move out at the end of the year and I had the idea of moving into my Grandmother&#8217;s unoccupied flat (she lives in a home).The only problem is my family.\xa0My Mother is my Grandmother&#8217;s Administrator so she makes all the big decisions when it comes to my grandmother&#8217;s affairs but because she is my mother, she can&#8217;t be seen as giving any preference to my because I&#8217;m her daughter.</em></p>\n<p><em>The issue with this is that even if it&#8217;s something she&#8217;d do for one of my cousins, if she does it for me then it&#8217;s favouritism. So she can&#8217;t make the decision and it has to be decided by her siblings, all 6 of them, most of which live interstate</em></p>\n<p><em>So the next person who the majority of the decision falls to is one of my aunts who does not get along with my Mother at all (which makes me sad but that&#8217;s a story for another day). She is on the board of directors for the family business (of which the flat is part of the building) and so would be setting the contract, rent etc.</em></p>\n<p><em>The first thing is that the flat needs some work before it&#8217;s habitable long term, the carpets need replacing because they are full of dust and mould, a proper stove needs to be installed and the bathroom may need refitting.\xa0</em></p>\n<p><em>Because this is such a potentially touchy subject, I can&#8217;t work out a way of asking whether it&#8217;s okay to move in (I am happy to pay for all utilities and rent as long as it&#8217;s appropriate) as well as bringing up the subject of renovations.</em></p>\n<p><em>The other part of the issue is that the kitchen gets used by staff members of the family business for lunches and also that the flat is usually available for visiting family.\xa0</em></p>\n<p><em>I am happy for these things to continue and to vacate if family need to use it but I&#8217;m not okay with paying top dollar if this is the case.\xa0I don&#8217;t feel that it&#8217;s fair that I have to cover water and power usage of the staff members either so I would like that to be reflected in what I have to pay as well.</em></p>\n<p><em>But I don&#8217;t know how to say that without causing a huge uproar or offending someone because I can see them taking it as if I am being selfish/cheap and un-family like.\xa0Is it right for me to ask these things? I&#8217;m not being unreasonable for not\xa0accommodating\xa0other people just because they&#8217;re family, right?\xa0I believe that family and business should be kept as separate as possible.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thanks in advance,</em></p>\n<p><em>Sick of Family Politics</em></p>\n<div></div>\n<div><span id="more-4074"></span></div>\n<div></div>\n<p>Dear Sick of Family Politics:</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to be blunt with you: There are other apartments that don&#8217;t need major renovation and won&#8217;t have staff &amp; family coming in and out of your place on the regular and that won&#8217;t make you beholden to your family. My strong suggestion is that you find one of those and bypass this whole thing, which will 99% only lead you to more hassle and moving out in a year anyway.</p>\n<p>If you do want to see if it&#8217;s even feasible, my suggestion is to email everyone who has a say in the decision &#8211; not just your mom, so she&#8217;s not in the position of advocating for you &#8211; and ask a simple question:</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Hi, what are your plans for Grandma&#8217;s flat? Would you be willing to rent it to me starting early next year? What kind of $ and terms would you be looking for?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Let them do the work of figuring out renovations, staff needs, and what to do about family visits. They&#8217;ll either go for the idea and quote you a price, which you can negotiate down (&#8220;Okay, I was thinking more along the lines of $____, especially if you&#8217;d still like staff and visiting family to have access to it, would that work?&#8221;) or decide is out of your budget, or they&#8217;ll refuse.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t do their work for them, either in terms of figuring out logistics and what they might need from the space or the work of rejecting your suggestion before they do. Just ask, act like it&#8217;s a reasonable request, give them a lot of say in how it happens, and see what they come up with.</p>\n<p>And in the meantime, look at other apartment situations. Realize that you will end up paying whatever you save on rent in the currency of constant intrusion and interference, guilt, family friction, total lack of privacy, and permanent expectations of supplication and gratitude.

I really do. We had a great relationship when I was growing up and we still do, for the most part. Generally she is an accepting, loving, level-headed person, albeit gullible at times.</em></p>\n<p><em>She is a Christian and a Republican. There is nothing wrong with that. People are allowed to have their own political and religious views as they see fit, in my opinion. That&#8217;s part of being an adult. She knows I do not have the same views as her politically or religiously, though, and she claims to respect that.</em></p>\n<p><em>However, she sends me these incredibly racist/anti-Obama/anti-</em><em>Liberal/anti-Muslim/anti-poor person/anti-Mexican/anti-gay/</em><em>etc. email forwards all of the time. Normally I try to ignore them because I don&#8217;t want to cause a rift in the family, but it&#8217;s gotten pretty unbearable. I have asked her several times to not send me emails of that nature and she always stops for a while, but then starts up again a few months later. For the record, she never mentions any of these emails when we talk on the phone or in person. It&#8217;s like she has a secretly hateful side or something.</em></p>\n<p><em>If I were to advise someone else, I&#8217;d probably tell them to block emails or send a sharp reply, but I can&#8217;t seem to give myself the same advice. I only get to see my parents a few times per year (they live a few hundred miles away, but I have no car and I&#8217;m poor, so it&#8217;s hard to get down there to visit), so every bit of contact from them is like a gift to me and blocking would make me feel terrible. And like I said before, I don&#8217;t want to cause a rift in the family by starting a fight.\xa0</em></p>\n<p><em>But these hate-spewing emails make me sad; sad that there are such hate in the world, and sad that my own mother would spread it (and perhaps sad that my mother is not the loving angel I&#8217;ve made her out to be in my mind&#8230;). There have been several times where I&#8217;ve started an angry reply, only to stop myself and walk away.</em></p>\n<p><em>With election season coming up, they&#8217;ve been coming again in a fairly steady flow. It&#8217;s gotten to the point where I get agitated if I see an email from my mom in my inbox.\xa0</em></p>\n<p><em>What would you advise I do about this? Block her email? Ignore the emails? Delete them? Refute them with facts? Remind her that she&#8217;s supposed to &#8220;love thy neighbor&#8221;?

It made me so sad, because he was one of the people who encouraged me to travel and be curious and to NOT be racist. Then he got old and spent all his time in front of Angry And Unbalanced News and forwarding eye-assaulting e-newsletters full of animated .gifs of weeping eagles and many fonts. Sometimes he composed his own lurid and completely fact-free tales about how Planned Parenthood volunteers go door-to-door canvassing for pregnant women and trying to &#8220;sell&#8221; them on their <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/planned-parenthood-opens-8-billion-abortionplex,20476/" target="_blank" title="The Onion: Abortionplex">awesome and profitable abortion-schemes</a>, written from the point of view of the fetus who a) could understand adult speech and b) was definitely going to grow up to be a fighter pilot or The Doctor Who Cures Cancer. Sometimes he included an evil (Insert Your Reviled Ethnic Group)-scheme to stop good white Christian women from breeding in order to skew demographics in &#8220;their&#8221; favor, foiled by this brave tiny soldier!</p>\n<p>I tried everything, including asking him directly not to send me political emails anymore and refuting the emails point-by-point. I sent him to <a href="http://www.snopes.com" target="_blank" title="Snopes">Snopes.com</a>. I sent him to <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/" target="_blank" title="Factcheck.org">Factcheck.org</a>. I sent him to <a href="http://isbarackobamaamuslim.com/" target="_blank" title="Is Barack Obama A Muslim?">IsBarackObamaAMuslim.com</a>. I recommended books by my former teachers and mentors, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Esposito" target="_blank" title="John Esposito">John Esposito</a>\xa0and <a href="http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/sonbola/" target="_blank" title="Amira Sonbol">Amira Sonbol</a>\xa0(Official Badass). I told him that I loved him but his insistence on forcing his politics on me in this way was poisoning our relationship. I tried the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ti-gkJiXc" target="_blank" title="How To Tell Someone They Sound Racist">Jay Smooth approach</a>, but<a href="http://www.inthesetimes.com/duly-noted/entry/12318/jay_smooths_tedx_talk_on_talking_about_race/" target="_blank" title="Jay Smooth\'s Ted Talk"> it didn&#8217;t work</a>.\xa0He died before\xa0<a href="http://yoisthisracist.com/" target="_blank" title="Yo, Is This Racist?">Yo, Is This Racist?</a>\xa0came out. Maybe it&#8217;s for the best. There was no way I was going to cut the old man off; I loved him fiercely despite his wack-ass views on religion and politics.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the only thing that worked:</p>\n<p>I made a filter with key words like Muslim, Obama (see also: O-bummer, O-bomber), Mohammed, jihad, socialist, birth certificate, abortion, 9/11, immigration, &#8220;illegals,&#8221; &#8220;states rights,&#8221; etc. Anything that pinged the dogwhistle filter would be filtered out of my inbox. I could look at it when and if I felt like it.</p>\n<p>Of course initially I checked the filter all the time, which defeated the purpose, but over time I checked it maybe once/month. My blood pressure fell accordingly.\xa0I also called my Grampa and emailed him regularly about nonpolitical things, so we had a non-awful stream of communication going.</p>\n<p>Initially he balked when he didn&#8217;t get the attention and response he was hoping for. &#8220;<em>Did you get my email? Why didn&#8217;t you answer my email?</em>&#8221; Because, you see, he would try to trick me and mix personal stuff with awful stuff.</p>\n<p>At which point I would check the filter and respond to everything in the emails that wasn&#8217;t political and ignore the rest. And man, it burned to let that stuff go unchallenged, but eventually he slowed down with it and we were able to keep the subject to non-hateful things.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s my recommendation: Filter, Ignore, Delete the emails. Talk to your mom about the interests you share and affirm your love for her. If she tries to steer the conversation toward politics, say, &#8220;<em>Mom, I really don&#8217;t want to discuss this with you. It always gets so ugly, and I just want to enjoy our time together.</em>&#8221; Believe me, if I thought saying &#8220;<em>Mom, I really think you&#8217;re wrong about this, can I explain from the heart why I think so?</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>Mom, could you tell me what appeals to you about those ideas? I really want to understand where you are coming from!</em>&#8221; would help one tiny bit, I would recommend it. Save your sanity points &#8211; you don&#8217;t have to fight every fight every time.</p>\n<p>You guys all know where the &#8220;hide story&#8221; and &#8220;hide user&#8221; buttons are on Facebook, right? Let me know if I need to include a quick tutorial to get y&#8217;all through the next month or so.</p>\n\t\t<div class="wpadvert">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4063/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4063/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=captainawkward.com&#038;blog=18848858&#038;post=4063&#038;subd=captainawkwarddotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />', 'language': None}]

        [{'base': u'http://captainawkward.com/feed/', 'type': u'text/html', 'value': u'<p>Ooh, these are posting out of order because I had several drafts in the hopper and scheduled them in the wrong order. We&#8217;ll live with it.</p>\n<p><em>Dear Captain Awkward,</em></p>\n<p><em>I am recently married and also a newbie mom. Before marriage and my then pregnancy, I had always considered myself a cheery person. But when I stopped working and got stuck in the house to take care of my baby, I got so bitter and envious of my husband. I feel bad about this because I know he\u2019s doing great in his job because he wanted a better life for us, yet I feel insecure of his accomplishments. It makes me feel inferior, stupid, and useless.</em></p>\n<p><em>I never wanted to admit this insecurity to my husband but I told him that I really wanted to work and staying in the house just makes me feel depressed. I always knew how much I hate staying in the house but it\u2019s only when I became a mom that I realized my lack of fondness for babies. I love my child because she\u2019s ours but I don\u2019t love the idea of staying at home. I told my husband about this and he agreed that it would be the best decision if both of us work. We do have this option anyway since we still live with my parents and we\u2019re not really on the rich side so we do have to work.</em></p>\n<p><em>When my aunt came to the picture she said that I was being selfish about me wanting to work. She said that I should just stay at home and take care of my baby, that it\u2019s the ultimate sacrifice a woman has to make, even mentioning her daughter who became a housewife since her firstborn. I was disgusted with what she said it made me reconsider if I was just being practical or just being selfish. It also made me thought if the depth of my insecurity is just part of postpartum depression.</em></p>\n<p><em>But my point is, I know in myself that I had done well in finishing my college degree and I don\u2019t want my dream to end with the arrival of my baby. I don\u2019t know if I need any advice but I just wanted to talk about this to someone like you.</em></p>\n<p><em>\xa0Sincerely,</em></p>\n<p><em>Awkward Mom</em></p>\n<p><span id="more-4059"></span></p>\n<p>Your baby is going to be fine, Awkward Mom, and you know why? Because you and your husband love your baby.</p>\n<p>A lot of well-meaning people are going to try to tell you how to parent in this life, and it&#8217;s going to be more about their own agenda than anything to do with you and your child. The more confidence you gain as a mom, and the more you get to know your child, the more able you will be to stare people down and say &#8220;<em>Wow, thanks, but s/he&#8217;s fine and happy, so I&#8217;m happy!</em>&#8221; The baby needs regular food. The baby needs sleep. The baby needs diapers changed. The baby needs shots and regular checkups. The baby needs lots of love and human interaction. The baby needs shelter &amp; clothing that keeps the baby appropriately warm or cool. If your baby has all that, your baby is FINE.</p>\n<p>If your aunt ever brings this up with you again, say &#8220;<em>Thanks, I&#8217;ll think about what you said</em>&#8221; and then do whatever the hell you were going to do anyway before she butted her giant nosy ass into your business.</p>\n<p>I know it seems counter-intuitive but this response has three benefits:</p>\n<p>1) It allows you to answer back instead of just sitting in silence. It won&#8217;t change her mind, but it&#8217;s good for you to say *something* out loud as a response, and a good habit to get into.</p>\n<p>2) It&#8217;s the truth. You WILL think about it, and then you and I will think &#8220;<em>Wow, what a self-righteous cow</em>,&#8221; and go on with our lives.</p>\n<p>3) It shuts off the conversation and leaves her without the fight or the opportunity to lecture you that she was spoiling for. The words that came out of your mouth weren&#8217;t rude, exactly, but you&#8217;ve told her to shut up and she won&#8217;t be able to figure out quite how.</p>\n<p>I think you were awesome and brave to know what you needed and to ask your husband for it. Some people really thrive on being stay-at-home moms. Some people don&#8217;t. Figure out which one you are and then, if economics and childcare situation allow, <strong>be that thing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without apology</span>.\xa0</strong></p>\n<p>Anyone who tells you that you should rejoice in &#8220;the ultimate self-sacrifice a woman has to make&#8221; (though I love that she admits that it WOULD be a sacrifice) is not looking out for you. <em>Dulce et decorum est</em>, much?\xa0A happier you = happier mom = better mom.</p>\n<p>I also want to say that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression" target="_blank" title="Postpartum Depression">postpartum depression</a> is a very real thing, so make sure you tell your doctor how low you&#8217;re feeling. It could be that getting out of the house and working will help shake you out of your funk, but please take your feelings seriously and get all the help on your side that you can.</p>\n<p>Your aunt can go eat fried worms.</p>\n<p>P.S. If she were telling you that you HAD to go back to work or else you were somehow ruining feminism, that would also be bullshit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<div class="wpadvert">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4059/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4059/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=captainawkward.com&#038;blog=18848858&#038;post=4059&#038;subd=captainawkwarddotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />', 'language': None}]

        [{'base': u'http://captainawkward.com/feed/', 'type': u'text/html', 'value': u'<div>\n<p><em>Dear Captain Awkward,</em></p>\n<p><em>I love my parents and younger brother &#8211; just in small doses. I currently live about a thousand miles away from them, which is great for me, although sadly, it hasn&#8217;t kept me out of the family drama.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p><em>My brother has dropped out of grad school, is living at home, has made almost no effort to look for a job, and when my mother tried to point out that his student loans are coming due and he needs some sort of income, he told her that he was an adult and she couldn&#8217;t tell him what to do. Mom was understandably upset about this, and called me to try to get me to talk some sense into my brother.</em></p>\n<p><em>When Mom and Dad came to visit me, Mom ended up crying on my couch for an hour over the whole situation. Dad refuses to acknowledge that there&#8217;s a problem with my brother&#8217;s behavior. He feels that it&#8217;s not necessary for my brother to look for a job right now, and that he can just sleep all day and play video games all night. Again, Mom called me to talk about it, because Dad refuses to.</em></p>\n<div>\n<p><em>My brother&#8217;s politics also come into it &#8211; we&#8217;re a family of liberals, and he&#8217;s a libertarian. There was a giant fight when Mom and Dad found out about this, and they (surprise!) called me to try and talk some sense into him.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m going home for week over Christmas, and Mom is already planning out a list of topics that she wants me to talk about with my brother, but I really don&#8217;t want to.\xa0 My feeling on it is that he&#8217;s an adult, and part of being an adult is that he can make his own decisions and his own mistakes. I&#8217;d be glad to talk to him about interview strategies and resume building if he was willing to take the help, but when I offered he ignored me and I&#8217;m not going to force him. I hate debating politics in general, and while I disagree with my brother, he&#8217;s entitled to his own opinions, and I honestly think Mom is hung up on his politics so she doesn&#8217;t have to deal with the real issue of him dropping out of grad school, refusing to look for a job, and being incredibly rude to her, while Dad doesn&#8217;t see anything wrong with it.</em></p>\n<div>\n<p><em>I love my brother. I love my parents. But I hate that my mother continuously expects me to solve all of my brother&#8217;s problems. I understand that I am the responsible one, at least in comparison, but\xa0I don&#8217;t know if I can go a week at home with my mother trying to get me to fix everything that is wrong in my brother&#8217;s life.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p><em>On top of that, I have major depression, an anxiety disorder, and a case PTSD from a sexual assault, so I really can&#8217;t deal with my family&#8217;s drama. (Before you ask, I&#8217;ve been in therapy and on medication for several years to deal with these things.) I&#8217;m also a little bitter because I would never have been able to get away with any of this &#8211; I worked three jobs in high school, I worked year round while I was in college, and I did everything to live up to my parents&#8217; expectations. On some level I get that not only is he the younger child but he&#8217;s also the *musician* so he&#8217;s special, the differences in how we&#8217;re treated are startling.</em></p>\n<p><em>I was wondering if you had a script for me to use with my parents while I&#8217;m at home for a week. If I&#8217;m getting this many phone calls and it&#8217;s still September, I&#8217;m terrified of what it will get to by Christmas.</em></p>\n<p><em>Responsible for Myself, Not for My Brother</em></p>\n<p><span id="more-4054"></span></p>\n<p>You are smart and you are doing everything to take care of yourself correctly. Internet ^5.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s your script:</p>\n<p>&#8220;That sounds really stressful, Mom. You should talk to brother directly about that.&#8221; + (Change of subject)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Wow, that sounds like a terrible idea. You should talk to him directly about that.&#8221; + (Change of subject)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mom, you should talk to him directly about that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mom, you should talk to him directly about that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You should talk to him directly about that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just keep repeating it (until it becomes ridiculous, if necessary) and then change the subject, and if the subject won&#8217;t stay changed say &#8220;We really need to change the subject now,&#8221; and if they still won&#8217;t change the subject say &#8220;I have to end this conversation now&#8221; and leave the room/hang up the phone/go for a drive/walk/run/jog/to get milk/to freshen up/to start dinner. If they bring it up with you in emails (I am shuddering at the agenda she sent you), respond to all the parts of the email that are NOT that and totally ignore that request as if it did not happen.</p>\n<p>When you get back from taking a powder, the clock resets, and you treat them normally and cordially until they bring up your brother again. Then, &#8220;<em>You should talk to him directly about that</em>.&#8221; Make it very boring and unproductive to keep bothering you about it. Keep a flat, even tone. Make it very happy and productive when they talk about other things.</p>\n<p>It is hard to keep doing this. It will feel mean and ridiculous. Your parents won&#8217;t like it and will try to push all your buttons.\xa0If they call you on the ridiculousness of it, you can level with them:</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Yes, it&#8217;s ridiculous to keep repeating the same thing, but I honestly have no idea what to say to the guy. If you have a problem with his behavior, you should talk to him directly about it.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Trust that you can ride out whatever displeasure they shower on you in return. You are sending a message that you are okay if they are upset with you, but you&#8217;re not okay with constantly being asked to intervene in your brother&#8217;s problems.</p>\n<p>What your mom wants from you is probably:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For you to validate and take this problem (and her anxiety) on as your own.</li>\n<li>For you to validate that they are good parents by being the Responsible One.</li>\n<li>For your role as the Responsible One to miraculously be transitive to your brother.</li>\n<li>To be her ally in the family when her husband isn&#8217;t backing her up. &#8220;Him&#8221; could also mean your dad.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can validate her feelings &#8211; &#8220;<em>Mom, that sounds really stressful and hard to deal with,</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>Yes Mom, I agree, the Venn diagram between libertarians and selfish assholes is a series of concentric circles, but we can&#8217;t change another adult&#8217;s politics</em>&#8221; &#8211; without taking the feelings or responsibility for your brother&#8217;s behavior. Your brother has shown that he doesn&#8217;t really give a shit what they say, so you are the child who will maybe Give A Shit, which is why they are talking about it to you and not him. You have to aggressively Not Give A Shit, which is a break from the role you&#8217;ve filled in the family before, and will be stressful for them and for you.\xa0Keep your chin up. Just because they don&#8217;t know how to set a boundary with your brother doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t set a boundary with them.</p>\n<p>Glad you live 1,000 miles away. Again, you are smart and good at taking care of yourself.</p>\n\t\t<div class="wpadvert">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4054/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4054/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=captainawkward.com&#038;blog=18848858&#038;post=4054&#038;subd=captainawkwarddotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />', 'language': None}]

        <br>
        [{'base': u'http://captainawkward.com/feed/', 'type': u'text/html', 'value': u'<p>Thanks to everyone who came to yesterday&#8217;s gelato-eating and gab session. The best part was sitting at the table and being able to identify who was there for the meetup by their 1) excellent fashion choices 2) friendly demeanor and 3) carrying-of-books. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll do other Chicago-based events, though as a reminder, you don&#8217;t have to wait for the team of Logic/Awkward/Machine if you want to plan something.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s questions involve some gross bathroom problems so they are going behind a cut in case you&#8217;re reading this at lunch.</p>\n<p><span id="more-4050"></span></p>\n<p><em>Captain Awkward et al,</em></p>\n<p><em>I have a bit of a scatological problem with my partner. It\u2019s not a big deal, but\u2026he doesn\u2019t have a very clear rear end. His boxers are skidmark heaven. This is not just a case of missing a little bit sometimes (which happens to the best of us!), but an ongoing situation.\xa0\xa0I know that this seems like an open &#8211; and &#8211; shut case of \u201cJust Talk to Him,\u201d but it is a little more complicated than that.</em></p>\n<p><em>Some background:</em></p>\n<p><em>He had a major colon infection in college. I don\u2019t know all the details, but I do know that it ended with two major surgeries where they removed a decent portion of his colon. He always talks about that experience as a terrible thing that happened to him, but treats it as something that is over, not something that has a lasting impact on our lives.\xa0</em></p>\n<p><em>One more thing: His parents house is, on a cleanliness scale of 1-10, a 3. I\u2019m not talking about clutter, I\u2019m talking about mildew in the bathtub. When my partner and I moved in together, he was surprised to hear that using a toothbrush with mold on the handle was not an okay thing.</em></p>\n<p><em>So here is my dilemma: If the doody undies are a result of his surgeries, I will consider this a low price to pay to get to wake up next to this guy. However, because of how he grew up, he legitimately may not know that the rest of us do not walk through life with burnt sienna drawers, and if it is changeable, I would like to alert him to this fact and get him to clean up.</em></p>\n<p><em>It isn\u2019t a huge deal, really.\xa0\xa0I only notice sometimes. The biggest real impact that it has is that he likes a little prostate stimulation now and again, and I would be way more okay with that if it wasn\u2019t so gross back there.So, how do I say to my wonderful partner \u201cHoney, your sleep shorts smell like shit and this is not normal?\u201d without embarrassing him about what may be a legitimate physical condition? Or do I not say anything because it isn\u2019t a deal breaker?\xa0\xa0I don\u2019t want him to feel self-conscious around me!</em></p>\n<p>Okay, I feel very comfortable saying this:</p>\n<p>If you know you are going to have sex with someone, you should do your utmost to make sure your butt isn&#8217;t covered in poop and maybe also make sure that your overall &#8220;area&#8221;&#8230;especially any parts you want someone to touch with their mouth&#8230;is clean. If you want your partner to touch your butt in any way, this is not only suggested, but mandatory.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sometimes sex happens spontaneously, before someone can complete such ministrations, or people are shaped in a way that they can&#8217;t reach everything, or disabled and need help, or they miss a spot for whatever reason. (I&#8217;m trying to get through this answer without saying, &#8220;Shit happens!&#8221; but obviously I&#8217;ve failed.) In such cases, if you notice something, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>entirely reasonable</strong></span> to say &#8220;<em>Honey, can you clean up a bit more?</em>&#8221; and if that sends the other person into paroxysms of shame, that&#8217;s not something you caused with your extremely reasonable request. Bodies are awesome but they are also weird and sometimes they leak.</p>\n<p>And please, if someone asks you to clean up a little bit, it doesn&#8217;t mean they hate you or aren&#8217;t attracted to you or want you to feel ashamed of your body and gross and trigger all your insecurities at once. It means that they want you to clean your bottom so they can get back to the sexy things they were doing to it.</p>\n<p>Of course every time you make a blanket statement like this, someone comes forward with an exception, so I&#8217;ll head you off at a couple of passes:</p>\n<p>1) Any time you insert something <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>into</strong></span> a bottom you risk encountering some trace amounts of poop. Okay, sure, the Risks We Run and so forth. Let&#8217;s let those be trace amounts, okay? As much as possible, start with a clean slate.</p>\n<p>2) It is my understanding that certain fetishists <span style="text-decoration: underline;">enjoy</span>\xa0poop or a dirty bottom. As long as you are consensual, careful about safety, and negotiate such play ahead of time with your partner, do your dirty deeds. It shouldn&#8217;t be a poop ambush, though.</p>\n<p>Letter Writer #353, I weirdly love this question, both because the subject of your email was &#8220;It&#8217;s Howdy-Doody Time!&#8221; and because it so neatly lays out the case for boundaries.</p>\n<p>Because even though you insist over and over that it&#8217;s &#8220;not a big deal,&#8221; you are allowed to have a reasonable expectation that your partner will clean his ass-area. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a make-or-break-up situation for it to bother you or for you to bring it up.</p>\n<p>And even if it&#8217;s the result of some kind of medical condition or failure of upbringing that isn&#8217;t his fault, you STILL need him to clean his butt before bed.</p>\n<p>The most respectful, least manipulative way to address something like this is head-on. Talk to your partner. Not during/immediately after/or right before sex &#8211; at some other time, when you&#8217;re both at home and awake and focused on each other.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Partner, this is awkward, but I&#8217;ve noticed lately that there have been some cleanliness issues with your butt &#8211; both around the area itself and with your underwear. Have you noticed anything like that?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>(let him talk, adapt follow-up as necessary)</p>\n<p>It helps when you bring up a problem like this if you can suggest concrete things that the person can do to make you happy. If they&#8217;re feeling defensive and helpless, you can refocus the conversation on actions. Their feelings are not yours to manage, but their actions affect you.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>In the short term, I need you to make sure you clean that area well before bed (so I can feel comfortable doing those things you like, which I also like). In the medium term, can you please make a doctor&#8217;s appointment? Even if it&#8217;s just to rule out any bigger problems, it would be good to get it checked out.</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Have the talk, see what he says, and the next time you notice a problem say gently <em>&#8220;Hey, can you take a second and clean up?&#8221;\xa0</em>The more direct and clear you are, the better. It&#8217;s okay to ask for this. And since we&#8217;re talking about hygiene: Inside a long-term relationship it&#8217;s good to get really comfortable with the other person&#8217;s body and understand that everyone farts sometimes and no one wakes up with minty-fresh breath, but the way you stay comfortable is to learn how to ask questions like &#8220;<em>Can we continue this after we&#8217;ve both brushed our teeth?</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>Will you jump in the shower with me for a minute?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Onward to #354.</p>\n<p><em>Dear Captain Awkward,</em></p>\n<p><em>I have a bit of an unusual relationship question that I was hoping you could help with.</em></p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m a mid-20&#8242;s straight-ish woman and for the past five years I&#8217;ve been in a wonderful relationship with a great feminist guy who works in the same field as me.\xa0 We met in college. We&#8217;ve lived together since the middle of college and moved into a lovely but very small 1 bed 1 bath apartment last year near our offices right after we graduated.\xa0 My problem is that in the past two years he has begun to spend a tremendous amount of time in the bathroom. Some days he will wake up in the morning, grab his laptop or our iPad and spend 2-3 hours sitting on the toilet in our bathroom.\xa0 Some days when we get home from work he will grab his laptop or the iPad as soon as we get home and then spend the entire evening on the toilet until we go to sleep.\xa0\xa0</em></p>\n<p><em>I told him that I don&#8217;t care how much porn he watches or reads because I like porn too, but he told me he&#8217;s actually usually just reading american comics or manga in there anyway and he sits on the toilet because his &#8216;stomach hurts a little or he &#8216;has a bit of gas&#8217; and &#8216;wants to be comfortable while reading.&#8217;\xa0 I&#8217;ve peeked in a few times when the door has been cracked and he&#8217;s literally just been sitting there reading comics on the ipad. I told him that even if he just wants to read comics all evening every evening it would be a little nicer if he didn&#8217;t have to spend all that time locked up in the bathroom.\xa0 I asked him if he was holing himself up in the bathroom all\xa0 the time because he wanted to avoid me and he told me &#8220;no&#8221; and seemed hurt at the suggestion.\xa0 I told him that if he wanted some quiet time alone I understood, but it would maybe be a bit better if he spent his alone time in the bedroom instead of the bathroom because sometimes I need to pee.\xa0\xa0</em></p>\n<p><em>We went to a doctor and the doctor told him he was perfectly fine aside from a bit of heartburn and stress, then gave him some heartburn medication and sent him on his way.\xa0 Despite taking the heartburn medication and feeling better, my boyfriend has continued to spend excessive amounts of time in the bathroom.\xa0</em></p>\n<p><em>My biggest problem with the whole thing is that sometimes this presents a bit of a logistical problem for me because we have only one bathroom.\xa0 Whenever I ask him when he will be out he only ever responds with &#8220;soon&#8221; and &#8220;soon&#8221; can mean anything from 2 minutes to another hour.\xa0 I&#8217;ve told him exactly this, but his response has been to get defensive and say &#8220;But I told you soon! Soon means soon!&#8221; This has come to a head on two separate occasions when he came out of the bathroom only to find me crying because I had to pee in the sink out of sheer desperation.\xa0 Each time he apologized to me and promised to be more considerate in the future, but then over the course of a week or so slipped back into his old ways.\xa0 Not only does his time in the bathroom keep me from peeing in a timely or normal fashion, but it also interferes with our social lives.\xa0 Some weekend mornings I&#8217;ll have to spend hours pacing around the apartment or reading the internet while waiting for him to get out of the bathroom because I need to brush my teeth or take a shower or something before I go out.\xa0 He won&#8217;t let me into the bathroom while he&#8217;s in there because he &#8220;can&#8217;t pee while anyone is watching.&#8221;\xa0 Most nights I can&#8217;t go to sleep until he leaves the bathroom because I need to brush my teeth or pee before sleeping. Sometimes this keeps me up pretty late at night and I&#8217;m very tired during work the next morning.\xa0 A few weeks ago we missed brunch with his sister on her birthday because he spent all morning in the bathroom.</em></p>\n<p><em>Captain Awkward, please help!\xa0 I don&#8217;t know how to tell him how much this hurts me without offending him!\xa0 I told him a few times that sometimes I need to use the bathroom too and spending all of his time in there is a bit inconsiderate and each time I brought it up he was very annoyed and defensive and told me that he always moves &#8220;as fast has he can&#8221; and that I should just wait because he will be out &#8220;soon&#8221; but, as I said before&#8230;sometimes his &#8220;soon&#8221; can take half an hour or an hour.\xa0\xa0</em></p>\n<p><em>What do I do?\xa0 At this point I&#8217;m at my wits end!\xa0\xa0 I would love to move to a two-bathroom apartment, but that&#8217;s just not in the cards for us right now.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thanks,</em></p>\n<p><em>-Boyfriend Won&#8217;t Leave the Bathroom</em></p>\n<p>This dovetails nicely with the last question, not just because of the bathroom connection.</p>\n<p>Something is going on with your partner&#8217;s health &#8211; whether it&#8217;s physical health or mental health, we can&#8217;t say (and as a reminder, site policy is that we do not try to diagnose strangers through the internet) &#8211; but it&#8217;s probable that, even if this started out as a weird-but-benign habit, his relationship with bathroom time has spiraled out of his own control.</p>\n<p>So again, something is going on that may not be entirely your partner&#8217;s &#8220;fault.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But again, you need to be able to go to the bathroom in your home where you live. You need to be able to get ready for bed, for work, and for social engagements in a timely manner. You NEED this stuff. You can&#8217;t make yourself not need this stuff, and you need it pretty much when you need it.</p>\n<p>Whatever the cause, his behavior is affecting you adversely. Holding in your urine for long periods of time can cause serious medical conditions &#8211; bladder infections, kidney infections \xa0- \xa0and <a href="http://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/features/the-truth-about-urine?page=2" target="_blank" title="Urinary Incontinence">lead to incontinence</a> later in life. You don&#8217;t want to die like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe#Death" target="_blank" title="Tycho Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a>. So this letter made me really, really angry at your partner. You shouldn&#8217;t be peeing in a sink. You shouldn&#8217;t be staying up later than your bedtime. You shouldn&#8217;t be crying from frustration over a basic biological necessity. Most adults urinate 4-7 times/day, so that means that this is a problem for you 4-7 times a day.</p>\n<p>I know you love this guy very much, but I really want you to take care of your own needs and put some boundaries in place for yourself. You said that you want to do this without offending him, or without making him (more) defensive and angry, but I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s not possible. He is INJURING YOU. He is disrespecting you. He is controlling one of the resources of your shared home so that you can&#8217;t have access to it. When you ask him to get out of the bathroom and he says &#8220;soon&#8221; but does not get out soon, he is LYING TO YOU.</p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t control anything about how he will feel, but you must speak up for your needs or risk doing real and lasting harm to yourself.\xa0I know it feels like speaking up firmly about this means that you risk hurting his feelings or making trouble in your relationship, but there is already trouble in your relationship. A lot of trouble. If the relationship isn&#8217;t working for you, then it isn&#8217;t working. If you can&#8217;t take a piss in your own house within reasonable expectations, it is not working, and the fact that he&#8217;s a &#8220;great feminist guy&#8221; matters not.</p>\n<p>Oh, I am so angry, LW. So angry. But let&#8217;s keep this concrete and focused.\xa0Here are some suggested things to ask for.</p>\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Immediately</span>:</p>\n<p>1) When you knock on the door and say you need to get into the bathroom, that is a two-minute warning for him to wrap things up and let you into the bathroom. &#8220;Soon&#8221; is bullshit. You will set a timer, and when it goes off, he vacates the premises without complaint. He can go right back in after he lets you pee or whatever. Script: &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s been two minutes. I need you to come out right now. You can go right back in when I&#8217;m done, but I refuse to pee in the sink or hold it until you decide that I get to go to the bathroom.</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>2) Between x o&#8217;clock and x-thirty in the morning is your shower/getting ready time. He cannot be in the bathroom during that time.</p>\n<p>3) On work/school nights, between x o&#8217;clock and y o&#8217;clock pm is your bathroom time. He cannot be in the bathroom during that time.</p>\n<p>And let&#8217;s be clear: Should you miss that window for some reason &#8211; oversleeping, staying out late at a social engagement, your 30-40 minutes of uninterrupted bathroom time starts when you say it does.</p>\n<p>Who is a friend or family member who lives close by that you could stay with? Because I think that if he does not respect these requests and makes you fight about them and push for them all the time, you need to be able to say &#8220;Okay then&#8221; and take a bag of your stuff and go somewhere else for (at least) 24-48 hours.</p>\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Within Two Weeks</span>:</p>\n<p>You will be making an appointment with a couple&#8217;s counselor. The topic: His bathroom time and how it affects your relationship. He will pay for at least 1/2 of the counseling sessions, he will attend them and be honest, and he will work with you on getting to the bottom of what&#8217;s going on here, even if it means seeking additional mental health treatment/medical treatment on his own.</p>\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Within One Month</span>:</p>\n<p>He is demonstrably working with you on fixing this and actively pursuing some kind of treatment. You have noticeably less friction around the bathroom and have no trouble using it when you need to. He has apologized thoroughly for his behavior.</p>\n<p>If it is not demonstrably better, please get yourself out of that house where you can&#8217;t pee. I think Evil Bees might live there, for real.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<div class="wpadvert">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4050/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4050/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=captainawkward.com&#038;blog=18848858&#038;post=4050&#038;subd=captainawkwarddotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />', 'language': None}]

And a free pass for everyone to tell you what you&#8217;re doing wrong!</p></div>\n</div>\n<div><em>\xa0</em></div>\n<div><em>Thank you so much for your wonderful column.</em></div>\n<div><em>\xa0</em></div>\n<div><em>My parents are very loving and I have a generally good relationship with them. I see them once a week or so, and I generally enjoy spending time with them. My mother and I have opposite ways of communicating, though: she simply can&#8217;t take criticism (I know that no one enjoys criticism), and will break down when any is given to her. She is passive aggressive, and in the past when I&#8217;ve talked to her about this kind of behaviour she defends it because she thinks that &#8220;being passive aggressive is kind because you don&#8217;t have to come right out and tell someone what they&#8217;re doing that&#8217;s bothering you&#8221;. She is also a fan of the silent treatment, although less frequently now because I no longer respond to it.</em></div>\n<div><em>\xa0</em></div>\n<div><em>I have the opposite approach: I tell people how I&#8217;m feeling immediately, but I am known for being a bit blunt sometimes. These two approaches don&#8217;t really work well together.</em></div>\n<div><em>\xa0</em></div>\n<div><em>She also deals with tremendous self-doubt and anxiety. I&#8217;ve encouraged her to go see a therapist, and she went for one session and then stopped because she found it too painful to talk about some of the issues that weigh on her.</em></div>\n<div><em>\xa0</em></div>\n<div><em>While I&#8217;ve generally been able to reject her manipulative behaviour, it has taken me years to recognize how her anxiety has affected me. I find it very contagious, and have worked hard not to take it on, especially in her company. It was a behaviour I learned from her when I was growing up that I&#8217;ve had to dismantle as an adult.</em></div>\n<div><em>\xa0</em></div>\n<div><em>My sister has just had a baby, and my mother&#8217;s anxiety has reached a new level. She is constantly worried that something is wrong with the baby because she&#8217;s too loud/quiet or moving too little/too much, and she yelps when the baby gets passed around because she&#8217;s terrified that her neck won&#8217;t be supported properly, etc. It&#8217;s a constant barrage of worries. It&#8217;s hard to be around, and it&#8217;s not useful for my sister and I to tell her that everything is fine. She just doesn&#8217;t hear us.\xa0</em></div>\n<div><em>\xa0</em></div>\n<div><em>I&#8217;m newly pregnant now, and I know my parents will be thrilled. My husband and I wanted to wait until after the first trimester to tell our parents (another two weeks from now), and I realize that part of this is because I have a medical condition that puts me into a &#8216;high risk pregnancy&#8217; category and I just don&#8217;t want to take on the anxiety around the pregnancy that my mother will thrust onto me. I also don&#8217;t want the baby to have to take on her anxiety, especially as the child gets older. I can certainly refuse to take that energy on, but my child will be subjected to it and it&#8217;s very damaging.</em></div>\n<div><em>\xa0</em></div>\n<div><em>My husband and I feel that having some sort of conversation with her before the baby is born will be important for us, but we&#8217;re just not sure how to navigate this territory. I suspect that she will either start sobbing and stop listening, deny/justify the behaviour or end the conversation. Is there a way for me to begin the conversation that can prevent her from feeling defensive? How do I talk through this with her? Any suggestions are deeply appreciated.</em></div>\n<div><em>\xa0</em></div>\n<div><em>Sincerely and with thanks,</em></div>\n<div><em>Trying to keep calm <span id="more-4044"></span><br />\n</em></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_4042" style="width: 310px;"><a href="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/crying-baby.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-4042" height="236" src="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/crying-baby.jpg?w=300&amp;h=236" title="Babies cry. It\'s just how they do." width="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Crying means you&#8217;ve failed and your baby is angry and stupid.</p></div>\n<p>Hi there, Keeping Calm! Commander Logic, here.</p>\n<p>First of all, congratulations! And allow me to pat you on the back for keeping quiet about your pregnancy; I just recently announced my own pregnancy, and yup, we waited for the all-clear 12-13 week finish line and ultrasound before telling family and friends. (WeeLogic: hitting the stands in March 2013!) And yup, my mom was a little put out that I didn&#8217;t tell her the instant the little peestick turned color/positive/whatever your own peestick did.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t tell my mom for the same reason(ish) that you didn&#8217;t tell your mom: I didn&#8217;t want to take her through the emotional roller coaster if this pregnancy didn&#8217;t &#8220;take&#8221; AND ALSO I didn&#8217;t want her to bathe me in her own anxiety, however well meaning and loving. I had plenty of my own anxiety, thanks!</p>\n<p>So be reassured: you&#8217;re doing everything right. And if you&#8217;d done it differently? You would also have been doing it right. Because being pregnant is just like anything else in life: <strong><em>you are the expert on what is right for you</em></strong>, so do what feels natural and makes you happiest.</p>\n<p>Now, where your mom is concerned, I need you to take a loooong step back with me. Let&#8217;s step back so far that we&#8217;re in the past! With your grandparents! Or Aunties. Or whoever was an older-than-mom person who took up grandparently duties. How much of an effect do you feel they had on forming your worldview? I&#8217;m going to guess less than your mom. A lot less. The lesson we&#8217;re going to take from this is that your mom will PROBABLY not pass on her issues to your child with remotely the same intensity that you experienced. I say &#8220;probably&#8221; because I can&#8217;t see the future, but I&#8217;m pretty confident that once-weekly visits or even daily baby-sitting in the early years won&#8217;t have as much of an effect as you fear.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_4040" style="width: 221px;"><a href="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/baby-washing-machine-211x300.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-4040" src="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/baby-washing-machine-211x300.jpg?w=590" title="Delicate cycle, right? Or steam clean?" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">How your mom thinks you&#8217;re bathing the baby.</p></div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s step forward to the present and how mom&#8217;s acting with your niece. While her anxiety is super annoying to the adults right now, it&#8217;s really not having much of an effect on the baby. Babies don&#8217;t really give a shit. Toddlers either. UNLESS she is needlessly interrupting sleep, feeding, or other baby procedures. Then it&#8217;s MamaBear vs. GMaBear times, and until that is your personal child being prodded, you need to step away and out of that fight. It&#8217;s for your sister to have, and then vent to you about. You two are lucky to have each other to vent to!</p>\n<p>But what you&#8217;re most concerned about is the conversation you feel percolating around your relationship between you, your mom, and your fetus, and to a certain extent your partner. But mostly the people connected by uteri, so I&#8217;m going to focus on that.</p>\n<p>What this is really about at the core is loss of control. Your mom was once the boss of you, when you were a child. She is no longer the boss of you. You are the boss of you. And when you have your baby, you will be the boss of that baby until it can be its own boss. BUT LETTING GO IS SO HARD. For many reasons, including love and attachment, but also because you get comfortable in the role of Boss of Everyone and having a child become their own boss can feel like a diminishment of some kind to a parent. Plus, nothing says &#8220;I&#8217;m my own boss now&#8221; quite so strongly as having your own children. So your mom is consciously or subconsciously trying to assert her bosshood, and it&#8217;s not going well because hey! She did a great job raising her girls to be their own bosses. Too good a job, in her (subconscious?) opinion. Now you might not need her. THEN SHE WILL BE USELESS. Cue the passive aggressiveness, wailing, gnashing of teeth.</p>\n<p>And I understand how much you want to &#8211; in turn &#8211; control your mom&#8217;s anxiety. SOMEONE has to control it, and if she won&#8217;t, then by golly her logical daughter ought to! Right? Wrong. You cannot be the boss of your mom. You can&#8217;t alleviate her anxiety, so I don&#8217;t think you should try. Do not carry that burden. I think you should try to let her anxious comments wash over you like a faintly acidic ocean breeze, then vent to your sister about OMG that last thing mom said, can you believe? Let her be the person she is, even if that person gets on your last nerve. That&#8217;s stuff for you to hash out, between yourself and the series of nerves between her and your last one. Practice the following sayings:<br />\n&#8220;Huh. Ok.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Everything is normal, but thank you.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;This seems to make [baby] happy, so we&#8217;ll keep doing this.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;I appreciate the offer, but we&#8217;re okay like this.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Oh, mom, I don&#8217;t want to worry you about that. It&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean let her get away with things that are actively harmful, like poking sleeping babies, feeding them dubious &#8220;herbal&#8221; shakes, shaking them to &#8220;encourage vigor,&#8221; or my personal favorite, while babysitting scheduling surreptitious screenings for rare diseases. Do not allow that business by any means. But if she&#8217;s just hectoring people to pay more attention to the baby, that&#8217;s totally normal first-time grandma behavior.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_4043" style="width: 160px;"><a href="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tupperware.jpg"><img alt="" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-4043" height="150" src="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tupperware.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150" title="&quot;She doesn\'t even FIT in the sandwich holder.&quot;" width="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Mom, I KNOW not to seal the baby in Tupperware. Stop putting these stickers on everything.&#8221;</p></div>\n<p>So let&#8217;s talk about what kind of prenatal talk you want to have with your mom. If you want her to be less anxious, I&#8217;m sorry to say that you will not get your wish (99.999% chance of fail). But what you both seem to need is some clarity about how she sees you and her own place in your growing family.\xa0 So DON&#8217;T bring your partner in on this. Have a lunch, just the two of you, where you frame it as &#8220;family history time.&#8221; Our moms are enigmas. They are so intimately intertwined with us, but so unknown, too. My mom has so much history that I both shared and know almost nothing about, since I was an infant or child at the time. I bet your mom is the same. Maybe she&#8217;s worried about someone dropping the baby because she dropped her cousin once. Or maybe she had a miscarriage that she never told anyone about. Maybe HER mom messed her up but good. I don&#8217;t know, maybe her mom wasn&#8217;t there for her at all, so she&#8217;s trying to make up for what she perceives as something she missed. But I am not a therapist! And neither are you (er, right?).</p>\n<p>So instead of telling her to tone down her anxiety &#8211; which is the job of a professional &#8211; just settle in and start asking questions. This is not a conversation titled &#8220;Mom, be less anxious&#8221; it&#8217;s about &#8220;Being pregnant is weird and different for everyone, and I need your help to make it easier for me.&#8221; This conversation may not &#8220;work.&#8221; This conversation may just be the first of several on this theme. But the goal is to find out what you both need from each other. Prepare for evasions (&#8220;that&#8217;s so personal!&#8221; and &#8220;what do you think I felt?&#8221; do not be dissuaded) and prepare to listen. A LOT:<br />\n- What was it like for you when you first had [first born kid in your family]? Did you have a lot of support? What was that support like (i.e. did your mom drive you up a wall? how?)?<br />\n- Was it different when you had more than one kid? How?<br />\n- Did anyone ever make you feel like a bad mom or pregnant person? How? What did you do about it?<br />\n- You raised me and [sibling(s)] into such independent people! Does that make you proud? How did you do it?<br />\n- What was your biggest fear for me and [sibling(s)] growing up?<br />\n- Do you see anything of your personality in me? Good things? Bad things? (be prepared for this answer to shock the hell out of you &#8211; either in recognition or outright lunacy)<br />\n- (Here&#8217;s the doozy and your finale.) Do you think I&#8217;ll be a good mother?</p>\n<p>If she says &#8220;no&#8221; to your final question, then that is actually on her for not seeing the amazing, thoughtful woman who wrote in here today. She may try to evade with &#8220;How could you ask me that?&#8221; but don&#8217;t let her turn it around on you. You don&#8217;t need her to know what you think (you&#8217;re 100% going to rock this mom thing), you need to know what SHE thinks. If she says &#8220;no&#8221; or &#8220;maybe&#8221; you are hereby allowed to discredit any mothering advice, hectoring, or insisting she bestows upon you. If she says &#8220;yes&#8221; then you have a bulletproof answer if she&#8217;s ever anxious about your baby. &#8220;Mom, you already raised a good mother, so I&#8217;m sure you know I&#8217;m raising my baby right.&#8221;</p>\n<p>TO RECAP with your mantras:<br />\n1 &#8211; You are the expert on you and your fetus and baby, and ur doin it rite.<br />\n2 &#8211; Babies don&#8217;t really give a shit.<br />\n3 &#8211; &#8220;Thanks but this is working fine.&#8221;<br />\n4 &#8211; &#8220;You raised a good mother, so please let me do it my way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keep calm, and carry on. You&#8217;re going to be a wonderful mother.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Commander Logic OUT.</div>\n\t\t<div class="wpadvert">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4044/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4044/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=captainawkward.com&#038;blog=18848858&#038;post=4044&#038;subd=captainawkwarddotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />', 'language': None}]

        <br>
        [{'base': u'http://captainawkward.com/feed/', 'type': u'text/html', 'value': u'<p>Wednesday afternoon, I&#8217;m on the Pink Line, staring into space, exhausted from teaching a 4-hour morning class after a night when I couldn&#8217;t sleep.</p>\n<p>50sish white dude with a baseball cap and a Sox jersey: &#8220;<em>I like your sunglasses, where did you get them?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how to describe this, but everything about the too-casual way he&#8217;s asking is fishy and ulterior. He&#8217;s working up to asking me for something &#8211; whether money or conversation or whatever &#8211; and I know I don&#8217;t want to talk to him.</p>\n<p>But on the off-chance he&#8217;s sincere (they are good sunglasses), I say &#8220;<em><a href="http://eyespyoptical.com/" target="_blank" title="Eye Spy ">Eye Spy</a>, on Lincoln</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He goes on chattering about the sunglasses and what he likes about them, and where exactly is that place, is it the one on such-and-such corner? And then he asks if I&#8217;m a student because I look like I just came from class. And you guys? I was done. I was so, so, so very tired. So I just stared at him without talking. I&#8217;m not sure I even meant to be mean &#8211; I was too tired to even think of anything to say.</p>\n<p>And then he repeated himself: &#8220;<em>ARE&#8230;YOU&#8230;.COMING&#8230;FROM&#8230;SCHOOL&#8230;you know, because you have a backpack?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>I did not respond.</p>\n<p>He waved and then SNAPPED his fingers in front of my face. &#8220;<em>Hellooooooo!</em>&#8221; and I kept staring at him.</p>\n<p>And then he got weirded out and backed away from me, muttering about how rude some people are, and went into the next car.</p>\n<p>I saw him yesterday on the train again (glory, we must have a similar schedule) and he said &#8220;<em>Heyyyyy, it&#8217;s the mean girl with the glasses</em>&#8221; and I gave him the death glare again until he moved away.</p>\n<p>Obviously casting <a href="http://dndtools.eu/spells/draconomicon--92/imperious-glare--1022/" target="_blank" title="Imperious Glare">Imperious Glare </a>or whatever isn&#8217;t magic protection from someone with truly bad intent, but I felt pretty great when he was the one to get uncomfortable and move away.</p>\n<p><span id="more-4033"></span></p>\n<p>Of course, a few stops later yesterday, a different gentleman (no baseball cap) looked at my grocery bags that say Trader Joe&#8217;s on the side and said brightly\xa0&#8221;<em>Going grocery shopping, I see!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Me: &#8230;</p>\n<p>Him: &#8220;<em>At the Trader Joe&#8217;s?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Me: &#8230;.</p>\n<p>Him: &#8220;<em>I only ask because I want to know what wine should I bring.</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Me: &#8230;</p>\n<p>Him: &#8220;<em>For when you cook me something later.</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Me: &#8230;</p>\n<p>Him: &#8220;<em>You don&#8217;t want to cook for me? Make me some pork chops or something?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Him: &#8220;<em>What, you got a boyfriend or something?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Him: &#8220;<em>Won&#8217;t even talk to a n&#8212;&#8212;. Damn.</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Him: &#8220;<em>You&#8217;re one cold bitch, you know that?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Him: &#8220;<em>I feel sorry for your boyfriend.</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Then it was his stop, so he went away.</p>\n<p>Then of course, last night, it continues.\xa0I&#8217;m riding the Blue Line to go meet my friend at a party in Logan Square, reading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Master &amp; Commander</span>.\xa045+ year old white dude (also in a baseball cap) plops down in the seat in front of me and asks something like, &#8220;<em>Hey, is that a good book?</em>&#8221; I honestly didn&#8217;t quite catch what he said or even realize he was talking to me at first, so I kept reading.</p>\n<p>Baseball Cap guy waves his hand in front of my face, again, like &#8220;<em>Helloooooooooo?????&#8221;</em> and asks louder,&#8221;<em>Excuse me, I <strong>said:</strong> &#8216;Is that a good book?&#8217;</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;<em>By &#8216;good book,&#8217; do you mean the kind where you get so immersed in the story that you shut out everything that&#8217;s happening around you because you want to find out what happens next?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Him: &#8220;<em>Yeah.</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>Me: :stares at him for a good while, watching it slowly sink in:</p>\n<p>Me: :goes back to reading:</p>\n<p>Him: &#8220;<em>&#8230;&#8230;Sorry.</em>&#8221; (sarcastic)</p>\n<p>Me: :keeps reading:</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say I was worried about my safety, though in the back of my mind I am always aware that\xa0<a href="http://unwinona.tumblr.com/post/30861660109/i-debated-whether-or-not-to-share-this-story" target="_blank" title="Unwinona\'s Terrifying Bart Experience">these things can go a different way</a>. So I guess in the back of my mind I WAS worried about my safety, but I&#8217;m so used to that feeling as a baseline hum that I don&#8217;t really think about it. I didn&#8217;t feel like I was in any immediate or acute danger. But after\xa0several such encounters in three days it&#8217;s left me feeling annoyed and tired and viewing pretty much anyone who comes near me on a train through the lens of &#8220;<em>What fresh hell is this?</em>&#8220;</p>\n<p>So for the Painfully Literal Dudes who are reading this and getting sad and thinking &#8220;<em>Does that mean I can&#8217;t even TALK to ANYONE on public transit EVER? That&#8217;s not FAIR because I&#8217;m NICE and you can&#8217;t paint me with the CREEPY brush it will probably just be because I&#8217;m UGLY anyway, you&#8217;d talk about nautical fiction with Brad Pitt if HE asked you and why do you even live in a city if you don&#8217;t want to talk to people anyway? You&#8217;re just being paranoid/oversensitive/need to get laid/need to relax/loosen up for chrissakes/are you really trying to say they were harASSING you?/maybe they were just awkward shy people who can&#8217;t read body language/are you really that fragile that you can&#8217;t handle a little conversation&#8230;&#8221; </em>etc<em>.</em></p>\n<p>I find that I am very comfortable with your bad feelings about that. I&#8217;m okay with you missing out on talking to a potential &#8220;prospect.&#8221; I&#8217;m okay if you feel weird and like maybe you shouldn&#8217;t talk to women on the bus or the train ever. I&#8217;m okay with you being worried that if you do you&#8217;ll be accidentally creepy. Can you spread that anxiety around to the general population? It might make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>We could make this a thread about how to avoid or respond to people who bother us in public, but honestly, I want to take a page from <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/09/12/stop-concern-trolling-victims/" target="_blank" title="Stop Concern Trolling Victims">this post </a>about stopping victim blaming and NOT give strategies to avoid harassment. All I did this week was ride public transit in a big city like I have for 20 years, sometimes while wearing cool sunglasses, sometimes with groceries, sometimes with a book. That should be enough to avoid harassment.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />\n</strong></span></p>\n<p>I took a taxi home last night (Cost: $15 + tip) even though the eL was right there, because I didn&#8217;t feel safe or up to the mental task of riding home by myself at 1 am. The cab driver played great music and drove me home in complete, beautiful silence and didn&#8217;t try to chat with me, so the tip was generous. Problem is, I don&#8217;t have a car or $15-$20 every time I want to go somewhere in the city where I live and avoid Chicago Transit Authority speed-dating.

        [{'base': u'http://captainawkward.com/feed/', 'type': u'text/html', 'value': u'<p><em>Hello, Captain.\xa0\xa0 </em></p>\n<p><em>I have a question about meeting internet quasi-celebrities!\xa0 Hopefully this is not something you get too terribly often.</em></p>\n<p><em>\xa0A few months ago, I attended a reading by a fairly well-known blogger/media reviewer whose work I admire for many reasons, but mostly because he\u2019s an extremely funny person and his ideas gave me a lot of insight into racism and classism and other \u2013isms I was pretty ignorant about up to that point.\xa0 (I\u2019ll just call him BloggerDude.) In the weeks leading up to this event I was alternately excited and nervous, partly because I have mild social anxiety and partly because I didn\u2019t want to either be overly fangirly or unwittingly say something offensive.\xa0 (Yes, this is something I actually worry about \u2013 not because I\u2019m particularly prone to shouting out offensive things, but because of the socially conscious tone of most of his blog and the amount of points he\u2019s made that I\u2019d never thought of before.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Anyway.\xa0 BD was on tour and was in my town for two days, and on the first night he invited his readers to just join him for dinner and hang out, so I did.\xa0 I met a lot of cool people and gave him a picture I had drawn of him with one of his favorite characters, and he seemed very pleased with it, to the point where he kept it next to his plate all through dinner.\xa0 Afterward, most of us went to the person\u2019s house where BD was staying and just laughed at stupid emails and YouTube videos.\xa0 The next day, at the reading, he and a few of the people from the night before were talking about his next tour stop and how they were all going to go and spend the weekend there before returning to MyTown.\xa0 I had to work that weekend or I might have decided to join them, since for most of them besides BD it appeared to be a spur-of-the-moment trip; as it was, I asked if one of them would let me know when they got back so we could hang out again before BD left MyTown for good.\xa0 They all seemed cool with that, and BD gave me his number.</em></p>\n<p><em>After that, I did not hear back from him.\xa0 I sent two messages \u2013 one Sunday and one Monday \u2013 asking about plans, and didn\u2019t pursue it beyond that; I figured he was doing his own thing.\xa0 However, since then I\u2019ve attempted to talk to him on Facebook a couple of times \u2013 not excessively; maybe two or three times since the beginning of May \u2013 and still got no response. \xa0We obviously aren&#8217;t the best of friends or anything, but I&#8217;ve seen him connect before with fans that he&#8217;s met, and I was under the impression that we all had a good time.</em></p>\n<p><em>I realize there are dozens of reasons why he could have chosen to not talk to me, none of which have anything to do with me specifically, and I also realize that Not Everyone Has to Like Me.\xa0 However, the part of me that\u2019s still gripped by social anxiety will continue worrying at my brain with this unanswered question until I know for sure whether this is because of something I\u2019ve done &#8211; and, if that does turn out to be the problem, I\u2019d like to know so I can avoid that in the future.\xa0My question is, would it be appropriate to ask BD if I\u2019ve said or done anything wrong?\xa0\xa0\xa0 And if so, what would be a good way to word it so as not to come off as OH MY GOD WHY WON\u2019T YOU TALK TO MEEEEEEEE? (I reeeeally do not want to be That Person.)</em></p>\n<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>\n<p><em>Hopefully Not A Fangirl</em></p>\n<p>Hi Fangirl!</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what happened:</p>\n<p>Blogger Dude TOTALLY enjoyed meeting you and hanging out.</p>\n<p>However, he thinks of you as a COOL FAN and not a FRIEND.</p>\n<p><span id="more-4023"></span></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s okay. It doesn&#8217;t mean you did anything wrong. Good artists/communicators/writers/people you&#8217;d want to become fans of are really good at creating a feeling of connection and intimacy with their audience. They make themselves vulnerable in their work, perhaps, or have a very relatable communication style. This guy obviously enjoys hanging out and interacting with his fans, and you weren&#8217;t wrong to enjoy that or to follow up with him via Facebook.</p>\n<p>The fact that he&#8217;s not replying to your messages means that you probably shouldn&#8217;t send him any more private messages, though. Even if there weren&#8217;t a lot of cool people competing for his e-attention, apply the &#8220;<em>Contact once, maybe twice, then let the other person contact you</em>&#8221; rule of reciprocity for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>any</strong></span> new acquaintanceship (potential friend, dating partner, employer, client, etc.)</p>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t ever interact &#8211; Twitter, Facebook, etc. make it incredibly easy to talk to famous people. You can say &#8220;<em>Musician, I love the new song!</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>Blogger, that post today was great and made me really think about issue X!</em>&#8221; or ask questions. You just have to do it with the assumption that you&#8217;re one of many, many, many people who are doing the same thing. Not getting a reply isn&#8217;t a personal rejection.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad you wrote to me and not to him. Sending him an email to ask <em>&#8220;whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy won&#8217;t you talk to me and did I do anything wrong?</em>&#8221; is the fastest way to get demoted from Cool Fan to Whoa, Maybe A Stalker. The answer is that he isn&#8217;t thinking about you all that much, because there are a lot of people who are Cool Fans. Writing to him in that fashion makes him have to take care of you around your anxiety. That anxiety? That&#8217;s <strong>yours</strong> to manage.</p>\n<p>Next time he comes to town, hang out and have a good time. Don&#8217;t ask it to be any more than a good time with someone you admire. Maybe over time and repeated hangouts you&#8217;ll get to know each other better, but you can&#8217;t make that happen. Trying too hard to make that happen is pretty much the way you guarantee that it never will. When people have a lot of demands on their time and people competing for their attention, the people who are super-relaxed and easygoing about it stand out positively.</p>\n<p>P.S. If Blogger Dude = <a href="http://www.illdoctrine.com/" target="_blank" title="Ill Doctrine">J. Smooth</a> I totally understand and share your admiration/crush/fangirlishness. That man is FINE and serves as the Imaginary Blogger Boyfriend to many of us.</p>\n\t\t<div class="wpadvert">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4023/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/captainawkwarddotcom.wordpress.com/4023/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=captainawkward.com&#038;blog=18848858&#038;post=4023&#038;subd=captainawkwarddotcom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" />', 'language': None}]
