An RSS/Atom feed reader. It's a desktop application which 
writes its output to HTML files and uses the webbrowser
as a GUI. This gives the best of both worlds: the speed
and flexibility of a Desktop app, and since no third-party
service like Google Reader is used there are no privacy 
concerns, while catering to the fact that most people 
dislike using stand-alone apps and prefer using something
that looks like a website.

The work of fetching and parsing feeds is done by 
Feed Parser and Feed Cache. 

The user has to install this as an app, and 'run' it in
the usual way by selecting the desired app from an 
application menu. Instead of launching a GUI, a 
webbrowser is launched.

Since the webbrowser can't save text files on its own,
 when the user makes changes to their settings they 
are given a link to a (data url) text file and asked 
to save it to the appropriate location.
