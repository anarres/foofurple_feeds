    <h2>About the Foofurple Feed Reader</h2>

    <h3>It looks like a website, but it isn't on the Internet; it only exists on your computer</h3>

    <p>
    Foofurple Feed Reader is actually a desktop application - a program that runs on your computer, not on an Internet server. However unlike most desktop applications, Foofurple Feed Reader doesn't have a graphical user interface (GUI) of its own. Instead, when you launch Foofurple Feed Reader, it generates some HTML files and displays them in your web browser. We set it up this way because we found that most people would rather use a web browser rather than a stand-alone desktop application. This website that your are reading right now isn't on the Internet; it only exists on your computer, but nevertheless it looks and behaves like a regular website.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I update the feeds?</h3>

    <p>
    Re-start Foofurple Feed Reader.
    </p>

    <h3>Why do I have to save a text file in order to save my settings?</h3>

    <p>
    Because Foofurple Feed Reader runs in your web browser, it can't just quietly save files to your computer without telling you first, it has to ask you explicitly to save them.

<h3>How can I find out if a website has a feed?</h3>


<h3>What websites don't have feeds?</h3>

<h3>What do all those words mean?</h3>

A feed (or RSS feed or Atom feed) is a web technology that lets you get an update whenever a new post is added to a blog, website, or podcast.

A feed reader is a website or desktop application that lets you read your feeds. There are lots of different kinds of feed readers, and they can look and feel very different from each-other. Some examples are the now-defunct Google Reader, the wordpress.com reader, LIST SOME MORE EXAMPLES, and of course, Foofurple Feed Reader.

Foofurple doesn't mean anything, we just wanted a distinctive name and we think 'foofurple' sounds nice.


<h3>I tried Foofurple Feed Reader out and it isn't working out for me, can you suggest something else I might try?</h3>
