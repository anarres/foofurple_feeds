<h2>About</h2>

<h3>What's a feed? What's RSS? What's Atom? What's a feed reader?</h3>

<p>FIXME</p>

<h3>What websites, social networks, and services offer feeds?</h3>

<p>Wordpress, 

<h3>Where can I find them?</h3>


<h3>If I have a choice between RSS and Atom, which should I choose?</h3>

<p>Atom.</p> 


<h3>Why can't I use Feed Reader to follow my friends on Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook?</h3>

<p>These services don't provide feeds, and their terms and conditions forbid syndicating their 
content.</p>


<h3>The master plan</h3>

<p>
The goal of creating Feed Reader was to give people a way to read RSS and Atom feeds for free,
with as much freedom as possible to control how the information is presented. So you can 
use feed reader to read whole articles, which can be great if the original website isn't that 
readable - a surprising number of websites have light grey text on a white background! Or you
can display just a few lines of each article, with the option to click a link if you want more.
You can use it to make sure you never miss a podcast, or you can use it to group together all
your favourite webcomics into one awesome stream. You can use Feed Reader as one half of 
a social network, and follow your friends on Dreamwidth, Diaspora, Identi.ca, Wordpress, and
any other web service that provides RSS or Atom feeds.
</p>


<p>
There are quite a few other RSS readers out there. Google Reader is popular and a lot of people
really like it, but it doesn't give you that many options for how to display your feeds. Moreover
a lot of people are concerned about the fact that when you use it you're giving Google a lot of 
information about yourself.
</p>

<p>
There are also quite a lot of very good feed readers that you download and install on your computer,
 such as Akgregator. These are much better from a privacy point of view, since only you know what
 feeds you choose to follow. There are some problems though. In general people don't like downloading and
 installing software, and are much more comfortable using something that runs in their web browser. 
Another problem is that changing the design and layout of this kind of application is difficult, 
and not many people know how to do it. It would be better to make an application that runs in a web
 browser, because there are lots of people who know how to design websites, so there would be a lot
more potential for people to collaborate to make the designs better, or to create new ones. So we 
decided to get the best of both worlds. Feed Reader is installed on your computer, not hosted in the
cloud by Google or some other company, which means you have control and privacy. But it uses your
 web browser to display the feeds, which makes it much easy to change the way the feeds are displayed.
</p>

<h3>Why do I have to save a text file?</h3>

<p>
Feed Reader uses your web browser as a user interface. This has lots of advantages - it makes it easier
to create different layouts or to change the design, and most people prefer using a browser. There is 
one disadvantage though: your web browser can't save information to your computer. So if you want to 
add new feeds or change the display, Feed Reader can't save your changes automatically. Instead, it
 askes you to save a text file.
