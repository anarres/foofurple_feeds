        <div class='item_main_main'>
            <p>While I&#8217;m most well-known for my work on <a href="http://lisa-wade.com/publications/#hook up culture" target="_blank">hook up culture</a>, I&#8217;ve written extensively on a different topic altogether: how Americans talk about <a href="http://lisa-wade.com/publications/#US discourse" target="_blank">female genital cutting</a> practices (FGCs), better known as female genital &#8220;mutilation.&#8221;  While FGCs are passionately opposed by essentially all Americans who learn about them, our understanding of the practices is, in fact, skewed by misinformation, ethnocentrism, and a history of portraying Africa as naively &#8220;backwards&#8221; or cruelly &#8220;barbaric.&#8221;</p>
<p>The main source of distortion has been the mass media.  Aiming to encourage journalists to think twice when covering the topic, the Hastings Center has released a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hast.81/pdf" target="_blank">report</a> by the Public Policy Advisory Network on Female Genital Surgeries in Africa.  In the rest of this post, I briefly discuss some of the things they want journalists &#8212; and the rest of us &#8212; to know and add a couple of my own:</p>
<p><strong>Using the word &#8220;mutilation&#8221; is counterproductive.</strong></p>
<p>People who support genital cutting typically believe that a cut body is a more aesthetically pleasing one.  The term &#8220;mutilation&#8221; may appeal to certain Westerners, but people in communities where cutting occurs largely find the term confusing or offensive.</p>
<p><strong>Media coverage usually focuses on one of the more rare types of genital cutting: infibulation.</strong></p>
<p>Infibulation involves trimming and fusing the labia so as to close the vulva, leaving an opening in the back for intercourse, urination, and menses.  In fact, 10% of the procedures involve infibulation.  The remainder involve trimming, cutting, or scarification of the clitoris, clitoral hood (prepuce), or labia minora or majora.  While none of these procedures likely sound appealing, some are more extensive than others.</p>
<p><strong>Research has shown that women with cutting are sexually responsive.</strong></p>
<p>Women who have undergone genital surgeries report &#8220;rich sexual lives, including desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction&#8230;&#8221;  This is true among women who have experienced clitoral reductions and undergone infibulation, as well as women who&#8217;ve undergone lesser forms of cutting.</p>
<p><strong>Health complications of genital cutting &#8220;represent the exception rather than the rule.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>News reports often include long lists of acute and long-term negative medical consequences of FGCs, and these may feel intuitively true, but <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12974204" target="_blank">efforts to document their incidence</a> suggest that health problems are, for the most part, no more common in cut than uncut women.  The Report concludes: &#8220;&#8230;from a public health point of view, the vast majority of genital surgeries in Africa are safe, even with current procedures and under current conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Girls are not generally cut in response to the influence of cruel patriarchs.</strong></p>
<p>Most societies that cut girls also cut boys; some groups that engage in cutting have relatively permissive sexual rules for women, some do not; and female genital cutting practices are typically controlled and organized by women (correspondingly, men control <em>male</em> genital surgeries).</p>
<p><strong>FGCs are not an &#8220;African practice.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The procedures we label &#8220;female genital mutilation&#8221; occur only in some parts of Africa and occur outside of the continent as well (<a href="http://worldpulse.com/node/12114" target="_blank">source</a>):</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/1.gif"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-52986" height="321" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/1-500x321.gif" title="1" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, cosmetic genital surgeries in the U.S. are among the fastest growing procedures.  These include clitoral reduction, circumcision of the clitoral foreskin, labia trimming, and vaginal tightening, not to mention mons liposuction, collagen injected into the g-spot, color correction of the vulva, and anal bleaching.  While it would be simplistic to say that these are <em>the same</em> as the procedures we typically call &#8220;mutilation,&#8221; they are not <em>totally different</em> either.</p>
<p><strong>Western-led efforts to eliminate FGCs are largely ineffective and sometimes backfire.</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that people don&#8217;t appreciate being told that they are barbaric, ignorant of their own bodies, or cruel to their children.  Benevolent strangers who try to stop cutting in communities, as well as top-down laws instituted by politicians (often in response to Western pressure), are very rarely successful.  The most impressive interventions have involved giving communities resources to achieve whatever goals they desire and getting out of the way.</p>
<p>In sum, it&#8217;s high time Americans adopt a more balanced view of female genital cutting practices.  Reading <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hast.81/pdf" target="_blank">The Hastings Center Report</a> is a good start.  You might also pick up <a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/56dpy3we9780252027413.html" target="_blank"><em>Genital Cutting and Transnational Sisterhood</em></a> by Stanlie James and Claire Robertson.  Full text links to my papers on the topic, including a <a href="http://lisawadedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/wade-2012-learning-from-female-genital-mutilation1.pdf" target="_blank">discourse analysis of 30 years of the academic conversation</a>, can be found <a href="http://lisa-wade.com/publications/#US discourse" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <p>I loathe to weigh in on the &#8220;war on men&#8221; conversation, but&#8230; alas.</p>
<p>While one can use both logic and data to poke gaping holes in Suzanne Venker&#8217;s argument that women need to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/11/24/war-on-men/" target="_blank">surrender to their femininity</a> and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/12/07/let-call-truce-in-war-on-men/" target="_blank">let men <em>think</em> that they&#8217;re in charge</a> if they ever want to get married, I just want to point out one thing &#8212; one endlessly repeated thing &#8212; that she gets very, very wrong.</p>
<p>Venker <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/12/07/let-call-truce-in-war-on-men/" target="_blank">claims</a> that there has &#8220;been an explosion of brain research&#8221; that proves that men and women have different brains.  This research, she claims, shows that men are loners who like to hunt and build things and women are nurturers who like to talk and take care of people.</p>
<p>This false on two fronts.</p>
<p>First, she&#8217;s wrong about the brain research.  The books and articles claiming that there are &#8220;pink&#8221; and &#8220;blue&#8221; brains are not consistent with existing research.  (They are out there because people can make a lot of money by confirming other people&#8217;s biases.)</p>
<p>What <em>does</em> the research say?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that scientists have documented a number of small, average sex differences in brain anatomy, composition, and function, as well as differences in size and tissue ratios.  (Other differences &#8212; such as the size of the corpus callosum and lateralization, whether one sex uses one side of their brain more than the other &#8212; have proven to be wrong.)</p>
<p>So, scientists do find some differences, but they have largely failed to link these to differences in men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s observed emotions, cognition,  or behavior.  That is, we&#8217;ve found some differences, but we have no proof that they translate into anything. Moreover, new research suggests that differences we observe may be designed not to create differences between men and women, but to reduce them.  The brain may have two strategies for achieving the same outcome or one difference may compensate for another.  (For more, see <em><a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Medicine/Neuroscience/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195188363" target="_blank">Brain Gender</a> </em>by Melissa Hines.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one reason why Venker is wrong.</p>
<p>The second reason is even more damning.  Most of the research attempting to explain gender difference <em>assumes</em> that there differences to explain.   In fact, meta-analyses aimed at summarizing the literature on human sex differences and similarities in traits, personality, cognitive abilities, sexuality, temperament, and motor skills offer better evidence for similarity than difference.  On the vast majority of traits, men and women overlap tremendously.</p>
<p>Janet Hyde, a pioneer in this area, did a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16173891" target="_blank">meta-analysis of meta-analyses</a> that combined the results of 7,084 separate studies. She found evidence for a large or very large difference on 8% of characteristics and evidence for medium-sized differences on 15%.  She found evidence for small differences on another 48%.  What does a small difference look like?  Here&#8217;s an example of a mid-range small difference (for self-esteem):</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/26.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52972" height="302" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/26.jpg" title="2" width="286" /></a></p>
<p>For the final 30% of characteristics, she found no evidence gender difference.  So, on 78% of characteristics, she found teensy differences or none at all.  Wow, &#8220;opposite sexes&#8221; indeed.</p>
<p>The truth is, men aren&#8217;t loners and women aren&#8217;t talkers. Venker assumes the stereotypes and counts on her readers to agree that they are true, but the data doesn&#8217;t back her up.</p>
<p>Two excellent books summarize the debates over gender and neuroscience.  Cordelia Fine&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cordeliafine.com/delusions_of_gender.html" target="_blank"><em>Delusions of Gender</em></a> is great for a beginner. She&#8217;s funny and you&#8217;ll learn a lot. Rebecca Jordan-Young&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674057302" target="_blank"><em>Brain Storm</em></a> is great for someone who wants and intermediate to advanced introduction to these issues.  Her book is downright brilliant.  I highly recommend both.</p>

            <p>Along with &#8220;work/life balance&#8221; and other tired topics, an evergreen issue in the media remains the <a href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2012/10/12/lessons-learned-from-breastfeeding-prof/">controversies surrounding breastfeeding.</a>  Less than six months ago, Jamie Lynne Grumet <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/05/30/controversy-over-times-are-you-mom-enough-cover/">lit up the blogosphere</a> by posing for the cover of TIME Magazine while breastfeeding her standing toddler.  Outcry included pronouncements that the image was almost pornographic, psychologically damaging to her child, and exploitative of her white, twenty-something good looks.  The drama of the image worked as the magazine flew off shelves and was named one of the top ten most controversial covers by the New York Daily News.</p>
<p>Within the &#8220;lactivist&#8221; community there seemed <a href="http://www.scienceandsensibility.org/?p=5790&amp;fb_action_ids=10100555305140847&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=other_multiline&amp;action_object_map=%7B%2210100555305140847%22%3A301086603344209%7D&amp;action_type_map=%7B%2210100555305140847%22%3A%22og.likes%22%7D&amp;action_ref_map=%5B%5D">to be double-edged concern</a> — on one hand, glee that an image of a breastfeeding woman was so publicly displayed — on the other, anger that the image so clearly did not depict the intimacy and bonding between mother and child that they insist breastfeeding promotes.</p>
<p>Sensing an opportunity to &#8220;set the record straight&#8221; as well as launch their own uptick in cover attention, the nonprofit quarterly magazine <a href="http://pathwaystofamilywellness.org/">Pathways to Family Wellness</a> persuaded Grumet to pose for them, this time surrounded by her husband, adopted son, and cradling her nursing naked now 4-year-old child in her lap.  The inclusion of other family members changes the image from one of solo defiance to a message about her family system.  On the cover, Grumet still looks directly at the camera, not at her feeding child, but her glance is far from defiant.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/17.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter  wp-image-52934" height="387" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/17-500x645.jpg" title="1" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Grumet agreed to pose again in order to send a different message about breastfeeding, one she preferred.  Grumet <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/lifestyle/2012/09/mom-breast-feeding-on-time-cover-poses-again-with-two-sons/">has said</a> that this image portrays toddler breastfeeding more realistically, &#8220;incorporating the husband and siblings.&#8221; Yet, the multicultural family portrait has its own sense of staging.   The idyllic family pile-on seems hardly part of everyday life, much less every feeding.  Both images – part of the wider debate over breastfeeding &#8212; are carefully crafted to tell a particular story.</p>
<p>Some critics have mentioned that while Grumet&#8217;s intention may have been to reframe the image of breastfeeding, perhaps unwittingly again, she has contributed to the <a href="http://www.bestforbabes.org/as-the-media-milks-the-time-cover-can-breastfeeding-benefit">fanning of the flames</a> around this issue. Others have accused her of &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.babble.com/strollerderby/2012/09/11/milking-the-moment-time-magazines-breastfeeding-mom-does-another-cover/">milking the moment</a>.&#8221;   The breastfeeding support website KellyMom tracked down the three other mothers who were all photographed for the TIME cover. KellyMom <a href="http://kellymom.com/blog-post/time-apmoms-interview/">interviewed them</a> about their experiences during the shoot, then reaction to, and fallout from the cover.  Unfortunately, given the nature of the debate, individual women can often seem like pawns in these ever-intermittent media storms.</p>

            <p>I was finishing up my dissertation in 2006.  The Great Recession was still two years away.  Nevertheless, there was talk about it being a tough job market for newly-minted sociologists and, like most everybody in my shoes, I was scared sh*tless about getting a job.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious now that I was extremely lucky to get out of grad school when I did.  A few years later the American Sociological Association (ASA) would <a href="http://cfd153.cfdynamics.com/research/ASAJobBankStudy09.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> that the number of jobs for new PhDs fell 40% from &#8217;06/&#8217;07 to &#8217;08/&#8217;09 (sociologists have a job &#8220;season&#8221; that straddles the New Year).</p>
<p><a href="http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Neal Caren</a>, a (gloriously employed) sociologist at UNC Chapel Hill, has been tracking the job market himself ever since.  His data, posted at <a href="http://scatter.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/jobs/" target="_blank">Scatterplot</a>, shows that the discipline has yet to recover from the Great Recession (<em>if</em> that&#8217;s the sole cause of the decline in job openings).  The yellow and green line represent the drop captured in the ASA report.  The purple line represents the devastating next year and the two blue-ish lines represent a slight recovery.</p>

<p>This year, however, the thick orange line, reveals that this year&#8217;s market is not signalling a recovery to the job market of my own debut.  It&#8217;s up 5% from last year, Caren explains,  15% from 2010, and &#8220;a whopping 73% from 2009.&#8221;  Extrapolating from the ASA data, we&#8217;re still down 33% from &#8217;06/&#8217;07.</p>

<p>A couple of months back I posted a video that illustrated the way that our expectations shape our perceptions. In it, <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/09/14/cognitive-bias-and-the-iphone-5/" target="_blank">Jimmy Kimmel gave people an iPhone 4 but told them it was an iPhone 5</a>. Believing they were holding a neat new Apple product, they identify a range of features that make it clearly superior &#8212; often holding it up to their identical iPhone 4s and perceiving significant differences between the two.</p>
<p>Following up on this theme, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=HxlGI4OzeBk" target="_blank">Kimmel followed up</a> by asking people on the street to try two cups of coffee and tell him which one had the new $7-per-cup premium coffee from Starbucks and which had a cheap brand. Except both cups of coffee were actually full of the same, non-premium, non-Starbucks coffee. Nonetheless, a number of testers immediately identify striking differences in taste between the two options, providing specific differences in quality that they think distinguish the coffees. It&#8217;s a fun illustration of a basic aspect of human cognition &#8212; that what we expect to see or experience affects how we interpret the sensory information we encounter:</p>

            by Lisa Wade, PhD
            
            

        </div> <!--.item_meta-->

        <div class='item_main_main'>
            <p>In 2011 the U.S. birth rate dropped to the lowest ever recorded, according to preliminary data released by the National Center for Health Statistics and reported by <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/11/29/u-s-birth-rate-falls-to-a-record-low-decline-is-greatest-among-immigrants/" target="_blank">Pew Social Trends</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/32.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52881" height="366" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/32.jpg" title="3" width="424" /></a></p>
<p>The decline was led by foreign-born women, who&#8217;s birthrate dropped 14% between 2007 and 2010, compared to a 6% drop for U.S.-born women.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/14.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52880" height="402" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/14.jpg" title="1" width="307" /></a></p>
<p>Considering the last two decades, birthrates for all racial/ethnic groups and both U.S.- and foreign-born women have been dropping, but the percent change is much larger among the foreign-born and all non-white groups.  The drop in the birthrate of foreign-born women is double that of U.S.-born and the drop in the birthrate of white women is often a fraction that of women of color.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/4.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52879" height="456" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/4.jpg" title="4" width="277" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget that effective, reversible birth control was invented only about 50 years ago.  Birth control for married couples was illegal until 1965; legalization for single people would follow a few years later.  In the meantime, the second wave of feminism would give women the opportunity to enter well-paying, highly-regarded jobs, essentially giving women something rewarding to do other than/in addition to raise children.  The massive drop in the birthrate during the &#8217;60s likely reflects these changes.</p>
<p>In addition to a drop in the number of children women are having, this data reflects <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/06/26/more-women-remaining-childless/" target="_blank">a steady rise in the number of women deciding not to have children at all</a>.  The decision to eschew parenting altogether is <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/09/24/women-education-and-trends-in-childlessness/" target="_blank">disproportionately high among highly educated women</a>, suggesting that the there-are-now-other-things-in-life-to-do phenomenon might be at play.</p>
<p>Many European countries are facing less than replacement levels of fertility and scrambling to figure out what to do about it (the health of most economies in the developed world is predicated on population growth), the U.S. is likely not far behind.</p>

<p>Liberal women want more sex.</p>
<p>Controversial sociologist Mark Regnerus has been <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/blackwhiteandgray/2012/11/liberal-women-and-sex/#comments">fooling around with</a> the New Family Structures Survey.  Back in June, Regnerus used the NFSS data to conclude that gay parents are bad for children.  Now, he runs the regressions and finds that liberalism leaves women sexually dissatisfied.</p>
<blockquote><p>Question:“Are you content with the amount of sex you’re having?”</p>
<p>The possible answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>No, I’d prefer more</li>
<li>No, I’d prefer less</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The differences were clear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/11/127.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter  wp-image-52813" height="243" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/11/127-500x347.jpg" title="1" width="350" /></a></p>
<p><em>Those liberal women, they try and they try and they try; they can’t get no&#8230; satisfaction. Hey, hey, hey &#8212; that’s what they say.</em></p>
<p>The differences held even with controls for how much sex the woman had had recently.  Nor did adding other possible explanatory variables dampen the effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he measure of political liberalism remains significantly associated with the odds of wanting more sex even after controlling for the frequency of actual intercourse over the past two weeks, their age, marital status, education level, whether they’ve masturbated recently, their anxiety level, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, depressive symptoms, and porn use.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regnerus says he was puzzled and asked an economist friend for her explanation.  She, like Regnerus, is a serious Christian, and saw it as a matter of seeking “transcendence.”  Liberal women want to have more sex because they feel the lack of sufficient transcendence in life and seek it in sex.  Conservative women find transcendence in the seemingly mundane &#8212; “sanctifying daily life” &#8212; so they do not need sex for transcendence.  Or as Regnerus puts it, “Basically, liberal women substitute sex for religion.”</p>
<p>To test this idea, Regnerus controlled for religious attendance.  When he did,  “political liberalism finally went silent as a predictor.”  Churchgoing liberals were no more insatiable than were their sexually content conservative co-worshipers.</p>
<p>So here’s the scenario.  All women want transcendence.  Since liberal women are not religious, they seek transcendence in sex and don’t find it.  They’re dissatisfied, but they cling to the idea that sex will bring them transcendence if only they have more of it.   So they keep looking for transcendence in all the wrong places.  Conservative women seek transcendence in religion and in everyday activities.  And that works.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Religion is deeply satisfying; sex, not so much.</p>
<p>This explanation, with its attribution of psychological-spiritual longing, makes some huge assumptions about what’s going on inside women’s heads.</p>
<p>I can offer a contrasting sociological explanation for Regnerus&#8217; findings.  It looks not to deep inner longings for transcendence but to social norms, beliefs, and values.  It rests on the assumption that people’s desires are shaped by external forces, especially the culture of the social world they live in.  In some groups, sex for women is good, so it’s OK for them to want more sex.  In other social worlds, sex for women has a lower place on the scale of values.  It is less of a “focal concern.”</p>
<p>These differences make for differences in who is content with what &#8212; a liberal, East Coast man and a WASP woman from the Midwest, for example:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Can we really say that the difference here is about spiritual transcendence?</p>
<p>In some social worlds, a woman can never be too thin or too rich.  In those worlds, women diet and exercise in a way we might find obsessive.  But that’s what their culture rewards.  Some cultures hold that sex is a good thing &#8212; certainly more pleasurable than dieting and exercising &#8212; therefore,  more is better.  In some social worlds, that’s the way some people feel about money.  Are these desires really about transcendence, or they about cultural values?</p>
<p>Oh, and on the sexual discontent matter, there are two other possibilities that may not to have occurred to Regnerus: (1) maybe conservative men are better lovers; they satisfy their conservative bedmates in ways liberals can only dream of.   Or (2) conservative men are so bad at sex that when you ask their partners if they want more, the answer is, “No thanks.”</p>

            <p><em>Cross-posted at <a href="http://montclairsoci.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Montclair Socioblog</a>.</em></p>
<p>Try not to think about an Oldsmobile.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about Oldsmobile.  I mentioned it in passing in <a href="http://montclairsoci.blogspot.com/2012/12/lincoln-and-party-images.html">the previous post</a>, and since then I’ve been wondering about “Not Your Father’s Oldsmobile” – the brand’s swan song.  Matthew Yglesias at <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2000/12/oldsmobile_victim_of_its_own_brand.html%20">Slate</a> thinks that the campaign alienated the regular customers, the ones who bought a new Olds every few years, saying to them in effect, “You’re a geezer, an Oldster, and have been for a while – sans youth, sans sex, sans taste, sans everything except your crummy car.”</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/13.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52875" height="300" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/13.jpg" title="1" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>The tag that completed the famous set-up line was, “The new generation of Olds.”</p>
<p>The target of the campaign was to attract young car buyers, but it missed badly.  Why?  My guess is the futility of negation.  Saying what something is <em>not</em> doesn’t give people a clear picture of what that something actually<em> is</em>.  But that’s not the problem here.  The message was clear, especially with that tag about generations.</p>
<p>The problem is that direct negation can reinforce the idea you are trying to deny – as in the paradoxical command to not think about an elephant. “I am not a crook,” said Richard Nixon in his televised address about Watergate.  It’s his most remembered line, and when he spoke it, the TV screen might as well have had an overlay flashing the words “Game Over.”</p>
<p>If the denial contradicts general perceptions (i.e., the brand), people might not hear it at all, or worse, they might hear the opposite.  Ever since fact-checking went public in a big way a few years ago, we’ve seen corrections to the lies that politicians have told about one another.  But as Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/nyhan-reifler.pdf%20">have shown</a>, corrections can boomerang, especially when they clash with ideas the reader already has.</p>
<blockquote><p>Can these false or unsubstantiated beliefs about politics be corrected? &#8230; Results indicate that corrections frequently fail to reduce misperceptions among the targeted ideological group. We also document several instances of a “backfire effect” in which corrections actually increase misperceptions among the group in question.</p></blockquote>
<div>By insisting that they weren&#8217;t old after all, Oldsmobile might have done more harm than good.</p>

            <p>Today we have an important public service announcement for you from <a href="http://www.africafornorway.no/" target="_blank">Radi-Aid: Africa for Norway</a>. The campaign has released a song and accompanying music video, imploring Africans to donate radiators to help Norwegians survive the difficult conditions in their country:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The real point of the video, of course, is to point out some of the problems with the images of Africa that are often presented in humanitarian fundraising drives by using a &#8220;We Are the World&#8221;-style song to turn the tables. The video&#8217;s creators argue that the constant depiction of Africa as a place of violence and misery is both counter-productive and generally obscures the actual cause of many of the problems, presenting the West as benevolent saviors while ignoring any role they might have in actually creating the conditions the fundraising campaigns are meant to address.</p>
<p>From the Radi-Aid website:</p>
<blockquote><p>The pictures we usually see in fundraisers are of poor African children. Hunger and poverty is ugly, and it calls for action. But while these images can engage people in the short term, we are concerned that many people simply give up because it seems like nothing is getting better. Africa should not just be something that people either give to, or give up on&#8230;We need to change the simplistic explanations of problems in Africa. We need to educate ourselves on the complex issues and get more focus on how western countries have a negative impact on Africa’s development. If we want to address the problems the world is facing we need to do it based on knowledge and respect.</p></blockquote>
<p>Erik Evans, one of the people behind the video, spoke to NPR about the video and the intent. You can listen to the segment <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/11/29/166162938/message-behind-african-heaters-for-norway-spoof" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <p><em>Cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-wade/liu-xianping-model-teen-clothing-line_b_2247586.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a>.</em></p>
<p>Anjan G. alerted us to an internet sensation, Liu Xianping.  The 72-year-old man in China has risen to fame modeling for his granddaughter&#8217;s clothing store, <a href="http://yuekou.tmall.com/?spm=a1z10.1.w7241745.1.fyH1oX" target="_blank">Yuekou</a>.  The clothes are designed for teen girls:</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/11/13.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-52730" height="291" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/11/13-500x291.png" title="1" width="500" /></a><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/11/2.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-52731" height="291" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/11/2-500x291.png" title="2" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://offbeatchina.com/modeling-for-teen-girl-clothes-on-tmall-72-year-old-grandpa-from-becomes-internet-sensation" target="_blank">Commenters</a> are impressed about Xianping&#8217;s ability to &#8220;pull off&#8221; this look, but we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised.  Masculinity and femininity are performances, and so is age.</p>
<p>While the idea that we &#8220;do&#8221; gender is no surprise to SocImages regulars, we also &#8220;do&#8221; age.  In fact, we have a whole language of age-related chiding that serves to get people to act in ways that we deem suitable for their number of birthdays.  Says sociologist Cheryl Laz:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Act your age. You&#8217;re a big kid now,” we say to children to encourage independence (or obedience). “Act your age. Stop being so childish,” we say to other adults when we think they are being irresponsible. “Act your age; you&#8217;re not as young as you used to be,” we say to an old person pursuing “youthful” activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Age, then, <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/12/15/the-social-construction-of-age-how-old-is-too-young/" target="_blank">is a social construction too</a>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Xianping&#8217;s adoption of feminine poses and youthful fashions makes him appear younger and more girly than we think he <em>should</em> look.  Importantly, though, he is no more an actor here than are actual teen girls.  Each is playing a part, both with the help of just the right accessories.</p>

            by Lisa Wade, PhD
            
            

        </div> <!--.item_meta-->

        <div class='item_main_main'>
            <p>There are six (progressive) tax brackets for income.  The tax rate paid by earners is bumped up each time they reach a bracket threshold.  The threshholds are determined by type of household.  Here&#8217;s a handy chart for 2012 from Wikipedia:</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/21.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-52842" height="147" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/21-500x147.jpg" title="2" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>U.S. politicians are now debating how these tax rates should change and they often focus on the &#8220;marginal&#8221; or &#8220;top&#8221; tax rate.  That&#8217;s the one that applies to the highest tax bracket, right now at 35%.</p>
<p>Dylan Matthews at the WonkBlog <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/11/27/should-the-top-tax-rate-be-73-percent/?wprss=rss_ezra-klein" target="_blank">notes</a> that the squabbling has been mostly over a percentage point or two.  Small beans, he asserts.  To put this in perspective, he includes this graph of fluctuations in the top tax rates throughout history (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/1.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter  wp-image-52843" height="499" src="http://static.thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2012/12/1.png" title="1" width="537" /></a></p>
<p>The green line labeled &#8220;income&#8221; correlates to the chart above.  You can see that especially income, but also corporate and capital gains top tax rates, have been shockingly variable since 1910.  They were about 25% right before the Great Depression, raised to about 95% during World War II, dropped to about 70% in the &#8217;60s, and have been on the decline ever since.</p>
<p>Matthews refers to a pair of economists, Nobel laureate Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez, who <a href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/diamond-saezJEP11opttax.pdf">argue</a> that the top tax rate should optimally be 73%.  Sociologist Jose Marichal, however, at ThickCulture, <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/thickculture/2012/11/28/us-tax-rates-illustrated/" target="_blank">observes</a> that tax policy has rarely been about what is optimal for society.  Instead, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>What these wild shifts in tax policy suggest is that our determination of how much we should tax our wealthiest is not based on any pragmatic assessment of what would result in the best policy outcome, but is rather guided by foundational assumptions about what is fair.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beliefs about what is fair are, of course, strongly influenced by cultural ideologies and group stereotypes.  Politicians both fall victim to their own biases and strategically invoke and create ideas and resentments.  We shouldn&#8217;t expect the current debate over how to change our tax code to be either rational or practical, then.  The debate will be <em>political</em>, but you already knew that.</p>

<p>On Thursday <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2012/11/syria-off-the-air.shtml">Syria’s internet was shut down</a>.</p>
<p>This is a serious situation with literal life and death implications.  Much of this story has yet to play out. Right now, I want to take a moment to explore one aspect of what this all means. Namely, I want to explore the question: why did the internet shut off <em>now</em>? To do so, I turn to Derrick Bell’s interest convergence theory.</p>
<p><a href="http://pscfiles.tamu.edu/links/div-com/bell-interest%20convergence.pdf">Derrick Bell’s theory of interest convergence</a> is a canonical statement on race relations. Bell famously argues that whites promote racial justice only when doing so converges with their own interests. The key example is the 1954 Brown V. Board of Education case, in which racial integration in schools served the larger U.S. message within the Cold War of human rights, freedom, and equality.</p>
<p>Although many scholars <a href="http://diverseeducation.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/derrick-bell-and-james-madison-on-interest-convergence/">critique the strong version of Bell’s</a> argument for its failure to incorporate agency among blacks, the root of the argument is quite useful in explaining power relations. In short, interest convergence theory tells us that the will of the powerful wades towards the direction of self-interest. When these interests converge with those of the less powerful, the less powerful are better able to achieve their will.</p>
<p>To a degree, I think this framework helps us understand the decision of the Syrian government to shut down communication channels. Syrian rebels utilized digital communication channels to both organize among themselves, and share their experiences &#8212; often in real time &#8212; with the outside world. This was instrumental in their cause both on the ground and internationally. The real question then, is why did the government maintain these channels for so long? This question is particularly blaring in light of extreme government atrocities, including mass killings of innocent citizens &#8212; including children. Moreover, why did the government decide to cut off these channels <em>now</em>?</p>
<p>Internet and communication blackouts are not unique among the Arab uprisings. Egypt and Libyan governments both shut down communication during their respective battles. The Syrian government, however, is unique in its deft use of digital technologies to quash protests, locate dissidents, and suppress the movement. In short, the interests of the powerful (i.e. the government) converged with the less powerful (i.e. the rebels). In addition to appearing somehow less oppressive to the international community, we see here a possible reason for maintaining Internet capabilities despite their strategic importance in the rebel movement.</p>
<p>However, we may speculate that the costs got too high for the government. We may speculate that in light a persistent rebel force, culminating in massive protests in Damascus &#8211; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/world/middleeast/in-syria-internet-and-main-airport-closed.html">so large that the major airport had to be shut down</a> &#8211; it no longer served governmental interests to maintain digital connectivity. The interests of the powerful and the less powerful no longer converged.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are other factors in play. This is a minuscule fraction of the story. With that said, this framework suggests that perhaps today’s act by the Syrian government was one of desperation. They were forced to give up a key oppressive resource (digital communication capabilities). This resource was no longer adequately effective for keep the uprising at bay. Now, they must all battle in the dark.</p>

<ul>
<li>This month we had the fun of being quoted in news articles on getting girls to embrace science (<em><a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/stereotypes-deter-women-from-becoming-scientists/1548504.html" target="_blank">Voice of America</a></em>), Sweden&#8217;s gender-neutral toy catalog (<em><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324205404578147373422297406.html" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a></em>), hook up culture (yes, again) (<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/hookup-culture-not-as-prevalent-as-believed-study-shows-1.2795055#.ULWqk-Q72Ai" target="_blank"><em>Brown Daily Herald</em></a>), and dollhouses (<em><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2236340/How-gender-neutral-dollhouses-finally-catching-mass-toy-retailers.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a></em>).  The latter involved us getting the word &#8220;heteronomativity&#8221; into the second sentence of a <em>Daily Mail</em> article!</li>
<li>The Daily Mail coverage was prompted by our counterintuitive post suggesting that <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/11/20/the-gender-politics-of-the-dollhouse/" target="_blank">the toy in question can be a feminist gift</a>, which also appeared at <a href="http://jezebel.com/5962277/the-gender-politics-of-the-dollhouse" target="_blank">Jezebel</a>.</li>
